<!--For example, the LENA^Â®^ system gives its users up to 16 hours of continuous audio recording at a time, along with software to help determine where in the recording researchers will find speech. By annotating sub-samples of these recordings (REFS: Weisleder) or by looking at other cues to interactional behavior (REFS: Romeo), researchers can then get insight into how often children are engaged in child-directed interactions at home. These estimates can then be compared with their language outcomes to check for correlations between what children hear and how they develop linguistically.-->

<!--In daily life, children often hear CDS during joint activities; events in which caregivers' and children's behavior is coordinated to accomplish some interactional goal (e.g., during mealtimes, grooming, and play).-->
