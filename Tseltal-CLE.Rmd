  Daylong at-home audio recordings from 10 Tseltal Mayan children (0;2–3;0) were analyzed for how often children engaged in verbal interaction with others and whether their speech environment changed with age, time of day, household size, and number of speakers present. Tseltal children were infrequently directly spoken to, with most directed speech coming from adults, and no increase with age. Most directed speech came in the mornings or afternoons, and interactional peaks took the form of ~1-minute bursts of turn taking. An initial analysis of children’s vocal development suggested that, despite relatively little directed speech, Tseltal children develop early language skills on a similar timescale to Western children. Multiple proposals for how Tseltal children might learn language efficiently are discussed.

# Introduction {#intro}
A great deal of work in developmental language science revolves around one central question: what kind of linguistic experience (and how much) is needed to support first language acquisition? In pursuing this topic, many researchers have fixed their sights on the speech addressed to children. In several languages, child-directed speech (CDS, speech designed for and directed toward a child recipient) has been demonstrated to be distinct from adult-directed speech (ADS) in that it is linguistically adapted for young listeners [e.g., @soderstrom2007beyond], interactionally rich [@bruner1983childs], preferred by infants [@manybabies2017], and facilitates early word learning [@cartmill2013quality; @hoff2003specificity; @rowe2008child; @weisleder2013talking].
<!--Due in part to its strong positive association with vocabulary size---a linguistic skill with economic value in modern post-industrial societies---CDS has also gained significant attention as a tool for 'successful' language development [REFS].-->

However, the role of CDS in typical language development is less clear once we take a broad view of the world's language learning environments. In any given linguistic community, the vast majority of children acquire the linguistic system and language behaviors needed for successful communication in the context in which they are raised. In many cases, prior ethnographic work suggests that successful adult-like communicative competence is typically achieved without frequent CDS [@brown2011cultural; @deleon2011language; @gaskins2006cultural; @ochs1984language]. If so, two important considerations arise: (1) while CDS is a powerful driver of learning in some contexts, it is unlikely to be universally fundamental for typical language development [@brown2014interactional; @brown2014language], and (2) we should do more to explore other types of linguistic experience and other features of the learning environment that allow children to extract the information they need to learn language.
<!--these cultural-linguistic contexts emphasize aspects of linguistic competence other than vocabulary size [@ochs1984language], undermining the idea that CDS is a universally crucial aspect of first language development. Indeed-->

Past work on child language development in communities with reportedly infrequent CDS [e.g., @brown2011cultural; @deleon2011language; @gaskins2006cultural; @ochs1984language] has tended to use rich linguistic and ethnographic methods that, while well-suited to characterizing language socialization, lack the quantitative rigor that would otherwise enable reproducible results derived from reasonably representative participant samples [but see @shneidman2012language]. This situation calls for work that applies quantitative methods from developmental language science in diverse ethnolinguistic contexts in order to build more robust theories of language learning. In this paper we investigate the language environment and early vocal development of 10 Tseltal Mayan children growing up in a community where caregivers have been previously reported to infrequently directly speak to young children [@brown1998conversational; @brown2011cultural; @brown2014interactional]. Our aims are to quantitatively ground these prior qualitative claims in order to reason about the fundamental factors for learning language in Tseltal Mayan (and similar) communities.

## Child-directed speech  {#intro-cds}
Prior work, conducted primarily in Western contexts, has shown that the amount of CDS children hear influences their language development; more CDS is associated with faster-growing receptive and productive vocabularies [e.g., @hart1995meaningful; @hoff2003specificity; @shneidman2012language], faster lexical retrieval [@weisleder2013talking], and faster syntactic development [@huttenlocher2010sources]. Given that CDS is designed for a child hearer, it is more likely than ADS or other-directed speech to align with the child's attention, and may thereby facilitate early language development. There are, however, a few caveats to the body of work relating CDS quantity and language development.

First, while there is overwhelming evidence linking CDS quantity to vocabulary size, links to grammatical development are more scant [but see @brinchmann2019direct; @frankIPvariability; @huttenlocher2010sources]. While the advantage of CDS for referential word learning is clear, it is less obvious how it facilitates syntactic learning [@yurovsky2018communicative]. On the other hand, there is a wealth of evidence that syntactic knowledge is lexically specified [e.g., @lieven1997lexically], and that, crosslinguistically, children's vocabulary size is one of the most robust predictors of their early syntactic development [@frankIPvariability; @marchman2004language]---what is good for the lexicon may also be good for syntax.
<!-- For example, utterance length [a proxy for syntactic complexity; @wasow1997remarks] doesn't appear to increase with child age [@newport1977mother], and parents may be less likely to directly correct their children's syntactic errors than their semantic ones [@brown1997introduction; but see @chouinard2003adult]---sometimes themselves producing ungrammatical utterances to make individual words salient [@aslin1996models]. For now, a direct link between CDS and grammatical development still needs further exploration.-->

Second, most work on CDS _quantity_ (i.e., how often children hear CDS) uses summary measures that average over the ebb and flow of the recorded session. In reality, verbal behaviors are highly temporally structured: infants' and adults' vocal behavior is clustered across multiple time scales of daylong recordings [@abney2017time], and nouns and verbs are used within short bursts separated by long periods across languages [@blasiIPhuman]. In fact, experimental work has shown that children sometimes learn better from bursty exposure to words [@schwab2016repetition]. Recordings of children's language experience over the course of entire waking days is critical for understanding the full range and distribution of linguistic interactions included in children's everyday language experiences [@soderstrom2013when; @tamislemonda2018routine].

Third, prior work has typically focused on Western (primarily North American) populations, limiting our ability to generalize effects of CDS to children elsewhere [@brown2014language; @henrich2010beyond; @nielsen2017persistent]. While we gain valuable insight by looking at within-population variation, we can more effectively find places where our assumptions break down by studying language development in communities that diverge meaningfully (linguistically and culturally) from those already well-studied. Linguistic anthropologists working in non-Western communities have long reported that caregiver-child interaction varies immensely from place to place, but that, despite this variation, children appear to achieve major communicative benchmarks (e.g., pointing, first words) on a similar timescale [@brown2011cultural; @brown2014interactional; @brown2014language; @gaskins2006cultural; @liszkowski2012prelinguistic; @ochs1984language]. These findings have had a limited impact on mainstream theories of language development, partly due to a lack of directly comparable methods [@brown2014interactional; @brown2014language].

A number of recent or ongoing research projects have used standard psycholinguistic methods to investigate language learning environments in traditional, non-Western communities, with several substantiating the claim that children in many parts of the world hear little CDS. Scaff, Cristia, and colleagues [-@cristia2017child; -@scaffIPlanguage] estimate, based on daylong recordings, that Tsimane children (Bolivian lowlands; forager-horticulturalist) hear approximately 4.8 minutes of CDS per hour between ages 0;6 and 3;0 when considering all possible environmental speech (Cristia et al., 2017; Scaff et al., in preparation; see also @vogt2015communicative). Shneidman and Goldin-Meadow [-@shneidman2012language] analyzed speech from one-hour at-home video recordings of children between 1;0 and 3;0 in a Yucatec Mayan and a North American community. Their analyses yielded four main findings: compared to the American children, (a) Yucatec children heard many fewer utterances per hour, (b) a much smaller proportion of the utterances they heard were child-directed, (c) the proportion of utterances that were child-directed increased dramatically with age, matching U.S. children's CDS proportion by 3;0, and (d) most of the added CDS in the Yucatec sample came from other children (e.g., older siblings/cousins). The lexical diversity of the CDS that Yucatec Mayan children heard at 24 months---particularly from adult speakers---predicted their vocabulary knowledge at 35 months, suggesting that CDS characteristics still play a role in that context. The current study uses both daylong audio recordings and standard measures of vocal development to better understand the process of language learning in a Tseltal Mayan community.
<!--For comparison, children from North American homes between ages 0;3 and 3;0 are estimated to hear ~11 minutes of CDS per hour in daylong recordings [@bergelsoncasillas2019what]. Note however, that these estimates from from a non-random sample of clips that were selected based on the presence of adult speech.-> 
<!--A growing number of researchers are using methods from developmental psycholinguistics to describe the linguistic development of children growing up in traditional or non-Western communities [see also @barrett2013early; @demuth2010three; @fortierURadhoc; @garcia2018thematic; @ganek2018using; @hernik2018infant]. We briefly highlight two recent efforts along these lines, but see Cristia and colleagues' [-@cristia2017child] and Mastin and Vogt's work [-@mastin2016infant; -@vogt2015communicative] for similar examples.-->
<!--Tsimane children also hear ~4.12 minutes of other-directed speech per hour (e.g., talk between adults) compared to the ~7 minutes per hour heard by young North American children [@bergelsoncasillas2019what]. This difference may be attributable to the fact that the Tsimane live in extended family clusters of 3--4 households, so speakers are typically in close proximity to 5--8 other people .-->

## Vocal maturity of spontaneous speech
Past ethnographic work has reported that, despite hearing little CDS, children in some contexts show no evidence of language delay [e.g., @brown2011cultural; @brown2014interactional; @brown2014language; @liszkowski2012prelinguistic]. We test this claim by comparing Tseltal children's achievement of major speech production milestones to those already known for Western children. In so doing, we report on the 'vocal maturity' of Tseltal children's spontaneous speech. Our vocal maturity measure is designed to capture the transition from (a) non-canonical babble to canonical babble, (b) canonical babble to first words, and (c) single-word utterances to multi-word utterances. This measure is, at best, a coarse approximation of children's true linguistic abilities, but it is an efficient means for getting a bird's eye view of children's speech as it becomes more linguistically complex over the first three years.
<!--The measure was originally designed with comparative language development in mind [REFS] and comes with tools for openly documenting and standardizing annotator training [REFS]. the data are not yet lemmatized or morphologically or syntactically annotated, but this would make it easier to do that quickly-->

Importantly, children's vocal maturity may be more subject to environmental factors as they grow older. The onset of canonical babbling during the first year appears to be overall relatively stable in response to variable language environments [e.g., @lee2018babbling; @oller1998late; @oller1995extreme]. That said, there is variation in the precise onset age of canonical babble; one longitudinal study showed an onset age range of 0;9 to 1;3 among children from a relatively homogenous middle-class sample [@mcgillion2017paves]. The same study showed that the age of onset for canonical babble significantly predicted the age of onset for first words. Once children begin producing recognizable words, environmental effects become more apparent; vocabulary size---even very early vocabulary---is known to be sensitive to language environment factors such as maternal education and birth order [@frankIPvariability; @arriaga1998scores]. Early vocabulary size is also a robust cross-linguistic predictor of later syntactic development, including the age at which a child is likely to have begun combining words [@frankIPvariability; @marchman2004language].

Therefore, if we indeed find that Tseltal children hear relatively little CDS, one might expect that the emergence of canonical babble would occur around the same age as it does in Western children, but that the emergence of single words and multi-word utterances—would diverge from known middle-class Western norms.

## The current study {#intro-currentstudy}
We examined the early language experience of 10 Tseltal Mayan children under age 3;0 using daylong photo-linked audio recordings. Prior ethnographic work suggests that Tseltal caregivers do not frequently directly speak to their children until the children themselves begin to actively initiate verbal interactions [@brown2014interactional; @brown2011cultural]. Nonetheless, Tseltal children develop language with no apparent delays [@brown2011cultural; @brown2014interactional; @liszkowski2012prelinguistic; see also @pye2017comparative]. We provide more details on the community and dataset in the [Methods section](#methods). We analyzed two basic measures of Tseltal children's language environments: (a) the quantity of speech directed to them (TCDS; target-child-directed speech) and (b) the quantity of other-directed speech (ODS; speech directed to anyone but the target child). We also then coarsely outline children's linguistic development using vocal maturity estimates from their spontaneous vocalizations.

Based on prior work, we predicted that Tseltal Mayan children would be infrequently directly addressed, that the amount of TCDS would increase with age, that most TCDS would come from other children, and that, despite this, their early vocal development would show no sign of delay with respect to known Western onset benchmarks.
<!-- We additionally predicted that children's language environments would be bursty---that high-intensity interactions would be brief and sparsely distributed throughout the day, accounting for the majority of children's daily TCDS.-->

# Methods {#methods}
## Corpus {#methods-dataset}
The children in this dataset come from a small-scale, subsistence farming community in the highlands of Chiapas (Southern Mexico). The vast majority of children in the community grow up speaking Tseltal monolingually at home. Nuclear families are typically organized into patrlineal clusters of large, multi-generation households. <!--More than forty years of ethnographic work by the second author has supported the idea that Tseltal children's language environments are non-child-centered and non-object-centered-->Tseltal children's language environments have previously been characterized as non-child-centered and non-object-centered [@brown1998conversational; @brown2011cultural; @brown2014interactional]. During their waking hours, infants are typically tied to their mother's back while she goes about her work for the day. When not on their mother's back, young children are often cared for by other family members, especially older siblings. Typically, TCDS is limited until children themselves begin to initiate interactions, usually around age 1;0. Interactional exchanges, when they do occur, are often brief or non-verbal (e.g., object exchange routines) and take place within a multi-participant context [@brown2014interactional]. Interactions tend to focus on appropriate actions and responses (not on words and their meanings), and young children are socialized to attend to the activities taking place around them [see also @deleon2011language; @rogoff2003firsthand]. By age five, most children are competent speakers who engage in daily chores and the caregiving of their younger siblings. The Tseltal approach to caregiving is similar to that described for other Mayan communities [e.g., @deleon2011language; @gaskins2000childrens; @pye1986quiche; @rogoff2003firsthand; @shneidman2012language].
<!--That said, other properties of Tseltal CDS may facilitate word and language learning, including conversational repetition and semantically specific verbs [@brown2011cultural]. -->
<!--Infants are rarely put on the ground. Therefore, children can't usually pick up the objects around them until they are old enough to walk. Toys are scarce and books are vanishingly rare, so the objects children do get their hands on tend to be natural or household objects (e.g., rocks, sticks, spoons, baskets, etc.). -->

The current data come from (corpus name and references retracted for review)<!--the Casillas HomeBank Corpus [@Casillas-HB; @HomeBank]-->, which includes raw daylong recordings and other developmental language data from more than 100 children under 4;0 across two traditional indigenous communities: the Tseltal Mayan community described here and a Papua New Guinean community described elsewhere (reference retracted for review)<!--[@brown2011cultural; @brown2014interactional]-->. This Tseltal corpus, primarily collected in 2015, includes raw recordings from 55 children born to 43 mothers. The participating families typically only had 2 to 3 children (median = 2; range = 1--9), due to the fact that they come from a young subsample of the community (mothers: mean = 26.3 years; median = 25; range = 16--43 and fathers: mean = 30; median = 27; range = 17---52). Based on data from living children, we estimate that, on average, mothers were 20 years old when they had their first child (median = 19; range = 12--27), with a following average inter-child interval of 3 years (median = 2.8; range = 1--8.5). As a result, 28% of the participating families had two children under 4;0. Household size, defined in our dataset as the number of people sharing a kitchen or other primary living space, ranged between 3 and 15 people (mean = 7.2; median = 7). Although 32.7% of the target children are first-born, they were rarely the only child in their household. Most mothers had finished primary (37%; 6 years of education) or secondary (30%; 9 years of education) school, with a few more having completed preparatory school (12%; 12 years of education) or some university-level training (2% (one mother); 16 years of education); the remainder (23%) had no schooling or did not complete primary school. All fathers had finished primary school, with most completing secondary school (44%) or preparatory school (21%), and two completing some university-level training (5%). To our knowledge at the time of recording, all children were typically developing. 
<!--While 93% of the fathers grew up in the village where the recordings took place, only 53% of the mothers did because of the way clan membership influences marriage and land inheritance.-->

When possible, we collected dates of birth for children using a medical record card typically provided by the local health clinic within two weeks of birth. However, some children do not have this card and sometimes cards are created long after a child's birth. We asked all parents to also tell us the approximate date of birth of the child, the child's age, and an estimate of the time between the child's birth and creation of the medical record card. We used these multiple sources of information to triangulate the child's most likely date of birth if the medical record card appeared to be unreliable, following up for more details from the families if necessary.

We used a novel combination of a lightweight stereo audio recorder (Olympus WS-832) and wearable photo camera (Narrative Clip 1) fitted with a fish-eye lens to track children's interactions over the course of a 9--11-hour period at home in which the experimenter was not present. Ambulatory children wore both devices at once ([Figure 1](#fig1)) while other children wore the recorder in a onesie while their primary caregiver wore the camera on an elastic vest. The camera was set to take photos at 30-second intervals and was synchronized to the audio in post-processing to generate snapshot-linked audio (media post-processing scripts at: https://github.com/retracted_for_review<!--https://github.com/marisacasillas/Weave-->). We used these recordings to capture a wide range of the linguistic patterns children encounter as they participate in different activities over the course of their day [@bergelson2018day; @greenwood2011assessing; @tamislemonda2017power; @tamislemonda2018routine].

## Data selection and annotation {#methods-samples}
Although the Tseltal corpus contains more than 500 hours of raw photo-linked audio, very little of it is useful without adding manual annotation. We estimated that we could fully transcribe approximately 10 hours of the corpus over the course of three 6-week field stays in the village between 2015 and 2018, given full-time help from a native member of the community on each trip. This estimate was approximately correct: average exhaustive transcription time for one minute of audio was around 50 minutes, given that many clips featured overlapping multi-speaker talk and/or significant background noise. Given this high cost of annotation, we sampled clips in a way that would let us ask about age-related changes in children's language experience, but with enough data per child to generate accurate estimates of their individual speech environments (see also retracted for review). Our solution was as follows:

We chose 10 children's recordings based on maximal spread in child age (0;0--3;0), child sex, and maternal education ([Table 1](#tab1); all had native Tseltal-speaking parents). We selected one hour's worth of non-overlapping clips for transcription from each recording in the following order: nine randomly selected 5-minute clips, five manually selected 1-minute top 'turn-taking' clips, five manually selected 1-minute top 'vocal activity' clips, and one manually selected 5-minute extension of the best 1-minute clip ([Figure 2](#fig2)). The idea in creating these different subsamples was to measure properties of (a) children's _average_ language environments ("Random"), (b) their most _input-dense_ language environments ("Turn-taking"), and (c) their most _mature vocal behavior_ ("Vocal activity").

```{r demog_table_prep, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
sample.demog <- ptcp.info %>%
  mutate(mat_age_rd = as.integer(round(mother_age, 0)),
         fat_age_rd = as.integer(round(father_age, 0)),
         hszrd = as.integer(round(household_size + 1, 0))) %>%
  select(age_childes, child_sex, mat_age_rd, mat_ed, hszrd) %>%
  rename("Age" = age_childes, "Sex" = child_sex,
         "Mother's age" = mat_age_rd, "Level of maternal education" = mat_ed,
         "People in house" = hszrd)
```

```{r tab1, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
apa_table(sample.demog, caption="Demographic overview of the 10 children whose recordings we sampled.")
```

The turn-taking and high-activity clips were chosen by two trained annotators (the first author and a student assistant) who listened to each raw recording in its entirety at 1--2x speed while actively taking notes about potentially useful clips. The first author then reviewed the list of candidate clips and chose the best five 1-minute samples for each of the two activity types. Note that, because the manually selected clips did not overlap with the initial "random" clip selection, the "true" peak turn-taking and vocal-activity clips for the day could have possibly occurred during the random clips. High-quality turn-taking activity was defined as closely timed sequences of contingent vocalization between the target child and at least one other person (i.e., frequent vocalization exchanges). High-quality vocal activity clips were defined as periods in which the target child produced the most and most diverse spontaneous (i.e., not imitative) vocalizations (full instructions at https://git.io/retracted_for_review<!--https://git.io/fhdUm-->).

                                levels = c("Random", "Turn taking", "Vocal activity"))

               aes(x = rec.start.hr, y = order, xend = rec.stop.hr, yend = order)) +

  scale_color_manual(values = c(viridis(3)[1], viridis(3)[2], "blue"))

```

The 10 hours of clips were then transcribed and annotated by the first author and a native speaker of Tseltal who personally knows all the recorded families. Transcription was done in ELAN [@ELAN] using the ACLEW Annotation Scheme [full documentation at https://osf.io/b2jep/wiki/home/, @casillas2017ACLEWDAS]. Utterance-level annotations included: an orthographic transcription (Tseltal), a loose translation (Spanish), a vocal maturity rating for each target child utterance (non-linguistic/non-canonical babbling/canonical babbling/single words/multiple words), and the intended addressee type for all non-target-child utterances (target-child/other-child/adult/adult-and-child/animal/other-speaker-type). Intended addressee was determined using contextual and interactional information from the photos, audio, and preceding and following footage; utterances with no clear intended addressee were marked as 'unsure'. We annotated lexical utterances as single- or multi-word based on the word boundaries provided by the single native speaker who reviewed all transcriptions; Tseltal is a mildly polysynthetic language (words typically contain multiple morphemes).

## Data analysis {#methods-analysisinfo}
In what follows we first describe Tseltal children's speech environments based on the nine randomly selected 5-minute clips from each child. We investigate the effects of child age, time of day, household size, and number of speakers on both TCDS min/hr and ODS min/hr. We then repeat these analyses, only now looking at the high "turn-taking" clips. Finally, we wrap up by outlining a coarse trajectory of Tseltal children's early vocal development.

## Statistical models
All analyses were conducted in R with generalized linear mixed-effects regressions using the glmmTMB package, and all plots were generated with ggplot2 [@brooks2017modeling; @R-ggplot2; @R-base]. All data and analysis code can be found at https://github.com/retracted_for_review (temporarily available as an anonymous OSF repository: https://osf.io/9xd5u/?view_only=03a351c1172f4d17af9fce634aefb65e)<!--https://github.com/marisacasillas/Tseltal-CLE--> Notably, both speech environment measures are naturally restricted to non-negative (0--infinity) values. This implicit boundary restriction at zero causes the distributional variance of the measures to become non-gaussian (i.e., with a long right tail). We handle this issue by using a negative binomial linking function in the regression, which estimates a dispersion parameter (in addition to the mean and variance) that allows the model to more closely fit our non-negative, overdispersed data [@brooks2017modeling; @smithson2013generalized]. When, in addition to this, extra cases of zero were evident in the distribution (e.g., TCDS min/hr was zero because the child was by themselves), we also added a zero-inflation model to the regression. A zero-inflation negative binomial regression creates two models: (a) a binary model to evaluate the likelihood of none vs. some presence of the variable (e.g., no vs. some TCDS) and (b) a count model of the variable (e.g., '3' vs. '5' TCDS min/hr), using the negative binomial distribution as the linking function. Alternative, gaussian linear mixed-effects regressions with logged dependent variables are available in the Supplementary Materials, but the results are broadly similar to what we report here.

# Results {#results}
Our model predictors were as follows: child age (months), household size (number of people), and number of non-target-child speakers present in that clip, all centered and standardized, plus time of day at the start of the clip (as a factor; "morning" = up until 11:00; "midday" = 11:00--13:00; and "afternoon" = 13:00 onwards). In addition, the model inluded two-way interactions between child age and: (a) the number of speakers present, (b) household size, and (c) time of day. We also added a random effect of child. For the zero-inflation models, we included the number of speakers present. We only report significant effects in the main text; full model outputs are available in the Supplementary Materials.

## Target-child-directed speech (TCDS)
The children in our sample were directly spoken to for an average of `r round(mean(quantity.rand.bychild$tds_mph),2)` minutes per hour in the random sample (median = `r round(median(quantity.rand.bychild$tds_mph),2)`; range = `r round(min(quantity.rand.bychild$tds_mph),2)`--`r round(max(quantity.rand.bychild$tds_mph),2)`; [Figure 3](#fig3)). These estimates are similar to those reported for Yucatec Mayan children [@shneidman2012language], as illustrated in [Figure 4](#fig4) (see @scaffIPlanguage for more detailed cross-language comparisons). Note that, to make this comparison, we have converted Shneidman's (2010) utterance/hr estimates to min/hr using the median Tseltal utterance duration for non-target child speakers (`r avg.utt.len.tseltal$median.utt.len` msec), motivated by the fact that Yucatec and Tseltal are related languages spoken in comparably rural indigenous communities.

We modeled TCDS min/hr in the random clips with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression. The rate of TCDS in the randomly sampled clips was primarily affected by factors relating to the time of day ([Figure 5](#fig5)). The count model showed that the children were more likely to hear TCDS in the mornings than around midday (B = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.COEF.morn[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.COEF.morn[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.COEF.morn[[3]],2)`, p = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.COEF.morn[[4]],2)`), with no difference between morning and afternoon (p = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.aft.vs.morn[[4]],2)`) or midday and afternoon (p = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.COEF.aft[[4]],2)`). Time-of-day effects varied by age: older children showed a stronger afternoon dip in TCDS. Specifically, they were significantly more likely to hear TCDS at midday (B = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.age.aft.vs.midd[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.age.aft.vs.midd[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.age.aft.vs.midd[[3]],2)`, p = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.age.aft.vs.midd[[4]],2)`) and marginally more likely to hear it in the morning (B = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.age.aft.vs.morn[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.age.aft.vs.morn[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.age.aft.vs.morn[[3]],2)`, p = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.age.aft.vs.morn[[4]],2)`) compared to the afternoons. Older target children were also significantly more likely to hear TCDS when more speakers were present, compared to younger children (B = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.COEF.agensk[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.COEF.agensk[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(tds.rand.zinb.COEF.agensk[[3]],2)`, p < 0.01). There were no other significant effects in either the count or the zero-inflation model.

In contrast to findings from @shneidman2012language on Yucatec Mayan, most TCDS in the current data came from adult speakers (mean = `r round(mean(1-propchitcds.rand.corr_age$avg_prpchitcds),4)*100`%, median = `r round(median(1-propchitcds.rand.corr_age$avg_prpchitcds),4)*100`%, range = `r round(min(1-propchitcds.rand.corr_age$avg_prpchitcds),4)*100`%--`r round(max(1-propchitcds.rand.corr_age$avg_prpchitcds),4)*100`%), with no evidence that TCDS from _other_ children increases with target child age (Spearman's _rho_ = `r round(propchitcds.rand.corr_age.test$estimate[[1]],2)`; _p_ = `r round(propchitcds.rand.corr_age.test$p.value[[1]],2)`).

## Other-directed speech (ODS)
Children heard an average of `r round(mean(quantity.rand.bychild$ods_mph),2)` minutes of ODS per hour in the random sample (median = `r round(median(quantity.rand.bychild$ods_mph),2)`; range = `r round(min(quantity.rand.bychild$ods_mph),2)`--`r round(max(quantity.rand.bychild$ods_mph),2)`): that is, nearly six times as much speech as was directed to them, on average. We modeled ODS min/hr in the random clips with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression. The count model of ODS in the randomly selected clips revealed that the presence of more speakers was strongly associated with more ODS (B = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.nsk[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.nsk[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.nsk[[3]],2)`, p < 0.001). There were an average of `r round(mean(quantity.rand$n_spkrs_clip), 2)` speakers present other than the target child in the randomly selected clips (median = `r round(median(quantity.rand$n_spkrs_clip),2)`; range = `r round(min(quantity.rand$n_spkrs_clip),2)`--`r round(max(quantity.rand$n_spkrs_clip),2)`), more than half of whom were typically adults. Older target children were also significantly less likely to hear ODS in large households, compared to younger children (B = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.age.hsz[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.age.hsz[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.age.hsz[[3]],2)`, p = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.age.hsz[[4]],3)`).
<!--That said, these estimates may be comparable to young North American infants (6--7 months) living in nuclear family homes [@bergelson2018day], so a high incidence of ODS may be common for infants in many cultural contexts.-->

Like TCDS, ODS was also strongly affected by time of day ([Figure 5](#fig5)), showing a dip around midday. Compared to midday, target children were overall significantly more likely to hear ODS in the mornings (B = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.morn[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.morn[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.morn[[3]],2)`, p = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.morn[[4]],2)`) and marginally more likely to hear it in the afternoons (B = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.aft[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.aft[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.aft[[3]],2)`, p = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.aft[[4]],2)`), with no significant difference between ODS rates in the mornings and afternoons (p = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.aft.vs.morn[[4]],2)`). As before, ODS rate varied across the day by target child age: older children were significantly more likely to hear ODS in the afternoon than at midday (B = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.age.aft[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.age.aft[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.age.aft[[3]],2)`, p = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.age.aft[[4]],2)`), with no significant differences between afternoon and morning (p = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.v2.COEF.age.aft.vs.morn[[4]],2)`) or midday and morning (p = `r round(ods.rand.zinb.COEF.age.morn[[4]],2)`). There were no other significant effects on ODS rate, and no significant effects in the zero-inflation models.

## TCDS and ODS during interactional peaks
The estimates just given for TCDS and ODS are based on a random sample of clips from the day; they represent baseline rates of speech in children's environment. How much speech do children hear during the interactional peaks the are distributed throughout the day? To answer this question we repeated the same analyses of TCDS and ODS as above, only this time using the high turn-taking clips in the sample instead of the random ones ([Figures 3](#fig3) and [5](#fig5)).

Children heard much more TCDS in the turn-taking clips---`r round(mean(subset(quantity.nonrand.bychild, sample == "turn-taking")$tds_mph),2)` min/hr (nearly 4x the random sample rate; median = `r round(median(subset(quantity.nonrand.bychild, sample == "turn-taking")$tds_mph),2)`; range = `r round(min(subset(quantity.nonrand.bychild, sample == "turn-taking")$tds_mph),2)`--`r round(max(subset(quantity.nonrand.bychild, sample == "turn-taking")$tds_mph),2)`)---while also hearing less ODS---`r round(mean(subset(quantity.nonrand.bychild, sample == "turn-taking")$ods_mph),2)` min/hr (nearly half the random sample rate; median = `r round(median(subset(quantity.nonrand.bychild, sample == "turn-taking")$ods_mph),2)`; range = `r round(min(subset(quantity.nonrand.bychild, sample == "turn-taking")$ods_mph),2)`--`r round(max(subset(quantity.nonrand.bychild, sample == "turn-taking")$ods_mph),2)`).

We analyzed both TCDS and ODS rate with parallel models to those used for the random sample, though this time we did not include a zero-inflation model for TCDS given that the child was, by definition, being directly addressed in these clips (i.e., there were no cases of zero TCDS in the turn-taking sample). Overall, time-of-day effects were weaker in the turn-taking sample. TCDS rate was not significantly impacted by time-of-day at all. Meanwhile, ODS rated _did_ show a significant time-of-day effect, but the dip in ODS came later in the day than what we saw in the random sample (i.e., afternoon, not midday; afternoon-vs.-midday: B = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.v2.COEF.aft.vs.midd[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.v2.COEF.aft.vs.midd[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.v2.COEF.aft.vs.midd[[3]],2)`, p = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.v2.COEF.aft.vs.midd[[4]],2)`, afternoon-vs.-morning: B = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.v2.COEF.aft.vs.morn[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.v2.COEF.aft.vs.morn[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.v2.COEF.aft.vs.morn[[3]],2)`, p < 0.01). Older children were also significantly more likely to hear ODS around midday compared to the morning (midday-vs.-morning: B = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.age.morn[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.age.morn[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.age.morn[[3]],2)`, p = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.age.morn[[4]],2)`), but heard significantly less ODS overall than younger children (B = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.age[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.age[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.age[[3]],2)`, p = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.age[[4]],2)`). Finally, whereas the number of speakers present had significantly impacted both TCDS and ODS rate in the random sample, it only significantly impacted ODS rate in the turn-taking sample (random sample: B = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.nsk[[1]],2)`, SD = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.nsk[[2]],2)`, z = `r round(ods.tt.zinb.COEF.nsk[[3]],2)`, p < 0.001). This result suggests that the number of speakers is a robust predictor of ODS quantity across different contexts. Full model outputs are available in the Supplementary Materials.

In sum, our results provide compelling evidence in support of prior work claiming that Tseltal children hear very little directly addressed speech [@brown1998conversational; @brown2011cultural; @brown2014interactional] and that their speech input is non-uniformly distributed over the course of the day [@abney2017time; @blasiIPhuman]. Do Tseltal children then show any obvious evidence of delay in their early vocal development?

We assessed whether the Tseltal children's vocalizations demonstrated transitions from (a) non-canonical babble to canonical babble, (b) canonical babble to first words, and (c) single-word utterances to multi-word utterances, at approximately the same ages as would be expected in a Western context. We generated descriptive statistics (summarized in [Figure 9](#fig9)) for the proportional use of all linguistic vocalization types in the children's utterances (non-canonical babble, canonical babble, single words, and multiple words). These figures are based on all annotated vocalizations from the random, turn-taking, and high vocal activity samples together (N = `r sum(chi.nvocs$n_vocs)` vocalizations). We had predicted that the emergence of canonical babble would occur around the same age as it does in Western children, but that the emergence of single words and multi-word utterances might theoretically diverge from known middle-class Western norms if Tseltal children indeed hear little CDS.

In fact, we find that Tseltal children's vocalizations closely resemble the typical onset benchmarks established for Western speech development, from canonical babble through first word combinations. Western children have been shown to begin producing non-canonical babbling around 0;2, with canonical babbling appearing sometime around 0;7, first words around 1;0, and first multi-word utterances appearing just after 1;6 [@frankIPvariability; @kuhl2004early; @pine1993reanalysing; @slobin1970universals; @tomasello1999early; @warlaumont2014social].These benchmarks are mirrored in the Tseltal children's vocalizations, which are summarized in [Figure 9](#fig9): there is a decline in the use of non-canonical babble and an accompanying increase in the use of canonical babble between 0;6 and 1;0; recognizable words are observed for every child from age 11;0 and older; and multi-word utterances appear in all recordings at 1;2 and later, making up 45% of the oldest child's (3;0) vocalizations.

```

### Frequency of vocalizations
We can use these same data to try and infer how _often_ children use speech-like vocalizations (i.e., "usage" instead of "onset" measures) (Warlaumont et al. (2014); retracted for review<!--@cychoszIPchivoc-->). Between 2 and 14 months, the Tseltal children demonstrated a large increase in the proportion of speech-like vocalizations (canonical babbling and lexical speech): from `r round(mean(subset(chi.vm.lx.voc.type.props.bin, max_voc.rtg == 1 & age_mo_round < 6)$prop_voc.type*100,2))`% before 0;6 to `r round(mean(subset(chi.vm.lx.voc.type.props.bin, max_voc.rtg == 1 & age_mo_round > 10)$prop_voc.type*100,2))`% between 0;10 and 1;2. There is limited daylong data already published with which we can compare these patterns, but we see that around age 1;0, the Tseltal children's use of speech-like vocalizations (`r round(mean(subset(chi.vm.lx.voc.type.props.bin, max_voc.rtg == 1 & age_mo_round > 10)$prop_voc.type*100,2))`%) is nearly identical to that reported by @warlaumont2014social for American children around age 1;0 in an socioeconomically diverse sample (approximately 60%). Futher, in a separate study, a subset of these Tseltal vocalizations have been independently re-annotated and compared to vocalizations from children acquiring five other non-related languages, with very similar results: the ratio of speech-like vocalizations to all linguistic vocalizations [canonical babbling ratio: @lee2018babbling; @oller1988role] increases similarly under a variety of different linguistic and childrearing environments between ages 0;2 and 3;0, during which time children in all six communities begin to produce their first words and multi-word utterances (retracted for review<!--@cychoszIPchivoc-->).
<!--Speech-like vs. non-speech-like comparisons are limited to age 1;6 in the ACLEW Annotation Scheme.-->
<!--Warlaumont and colleagues (2014) found that infants used ~60% speech-like vocalizations (speech, non-word babble, and singing) around age 1;0 in their ~0.85 at age fourSES-variable dataset of 106 children. For We estimated the number of speech-like (canonical babbling and lexical speech) and non-speech-like (cries, laughter, and non-canonical babbles) vocalizations from Tseltal children 14 months and younger across the random, turn-taking, and high vocal activity samples (N = `r sum(chi.nvocs.all$n_vocs)` from `r length(unique(chi.nvocs.all$aclew_child_id))` children).-->

We also found that, in general, the Tseltal children did not vocalize very often: they produced an average of `r round(mean(chi.nvocs$n_vocs)/60,2)` vocalizations per minute (median = `r round(median(chi.nvocs$n_vocs)/60,2)`; range = `r round(min(chi.nvocs$n_vocs)/60,2)`--`r round(max(chi.nvocs$n_vocs)/60,2)`) during their full one hour of annotated audio (including the high vocal activity minutes), much of which was crying and laughter. This rate is consistent with prior estimates for the frequency of child-initiated prompts in Tseltal interaction [@brown2011cultural]. Given that our age range goes all the way up to 3;0, this rate is perhaps lower than what would be expected from past work on recordings made in the lab [@oller1994speech; @oller1995extreme], in which 6--9 vocalizations per minute was already evident at 16 months across a socioeconomically diverse sample of U.S. participants. This finding would then appear to be in-line with the idea that rate of vocalization is sensitive to the language environment [@oller1994speech; @oller1995extreme; @warlaumont2014social]. That said, vocalization rate estimates from daylong recordings would be necessary to more validly compare overall vocalization rates in this case.
<!--The rate of infant vocalizations, may influence caregiver CDS patterns in Tseltal, as it appears to in a U.S. context, [@warlaumont2014social], which means that even though children are using relatively sophisticated ...

# Discussion {#disc}
We analyzed 10 Tseltal Mayan children's speech environments in order to estimate how often they have the opportunity to attend and respond to speech. Based on prior work, we predicted infrequent, but bursty use of TCDS, an increase in TCDS with age, that a large proportion of TCDS would come from other children, and that vocal development would be on par with typically developing Western children. Only some of these predictions were borne out in the analyses. We did find evidence for infrequent use of TCDS and for a typical-looking trajectory of vocal development, but we also found that most directed speech came from adults, and that the quantity of directed speech was stable across the first three years of life. Within individual recordings, TCDS and contingent responding were influenced by the time of day and number of speakers present. That said, time of day and number of speakers less strongly impacted TCDS during high turn-taking clips, suggesting that interactional peaks are one source of stable, high-engagement linguistic experience available to Tseltal children in the first few years of life. These findings only partly replicate estimates of child language input and development in previous work on Yucatec Mayan and Tseltal Mayan communities (Yucatec: Shneidman & Goldin-Meadow 2012; Tseltal: Brown, 1998, 2011, 2014), and bring new questions to light regarding the distribution of child-directed speech over activities and interactant types in Mayan children's speech environments.

## Robust learning with less child-directed speech
The bulk of our analyses were aimed at understanding how much speech Tseltal children hear: we wanted to know how often they were directly spoken to and how often they might have been able to listen to speech directed to others. Consistent with prior work, the children were only infrequently directly spoken to: an average of `r round(mean(quantity.rand.bychild$tds_mph),2)` minutes per hour in the random sample. This average TCDS rate for Tseltal is approximately a third of that found for North American children [@bergelsoncasillas2019what], but is comparable to that for Tsimane children [@scaffIPlanguage] and Yucatec Mayan children [@shneidman2012language] in a similar age range. Meanwhile, we found that the children had an enormous quantity of other-directed speech in their environment, averaging `r round(mean(quantity.rand.bychild$ods_mph),2)` minutes per hour in the random sample, which is more than has been previously reported for other cultural settings [e.g., @bergelsoncasillas2019what; @scaffIPlanguage].

In sum, our daylong recording results confirm prior claims that Tseltal children, like other Mayan children, are not often directly spoken to. When they are, much of their speech comes in interactional sequences in which children only play a minor part---directly contingent turn transitions between children and their interlocutors are relatively rare. However, we coarsely estimate that the typical child under age 3;0 experiences nearly two cumulative hours of high-intensity contingent interaction with TCDS per day. If child-directed speech quantity linearly feeds language development (such that more input begets more (advanced) output), then the estimates presented here would lead us to expect Tseltal to be delayed in their language development. However, our analyses suggest that Tseltal children demonstrate vocal maturity comparable to children from societies in which TCDS is known to be more frequent [@frankIPvariability; @kuhl2004early; @pine1993reanalysing; @slobin1970universals; @tomasello1999early; @warlaumont2014social]. How might Tseltal children manage this feat?

### Other-directed speech
One proposal is that Mayan children become experts at learning from observation during their daily interactions [@deleon2011language; @rogoff2003firsthand; @shneidman2010language; @shneidman2012language]. In the randomly selected clips, children were within hearing distance of other-directed speech for an average of  `r round(mean(quantity.rand.bychild$ods_mph),2)` minutes per hour. This large quantity of ODS is likely due to the fact that Tseltal children tend to live in households with more people compared to North American children [@shneidman2012language]. In our data, the presence of more speakers was associated with significantly more other-directed speech, both based on the number of individual voices present in the clip and on the number of people living in the household (for younger children). The presence of more speakers had no overall impact on the quantity of TCDS children experienced, but older children were more likely than younger children to hear TCDS when more speakers were present. These findings ring true with Brown's [-@brown2011cultural; -@brown2014interactional] claim that this Tseltal community is a non-child-centric; the presence of more people primarily increases talk amongst the other speakers (i.e., not to young children). But, as children become more sophisticated language users, they are more likely to participate in others' talk. However, given that an increase in the number of speakers is also likely associated with an increase in the amount of overlapping speech, we suggest that attention to ODS is unlikely to be the primary mechanism underlying the robustness of early vocal development in Tseltal. However, just because speech is hearable does not mean the children are attending to it. Follow-up work on the role of ODS in language development must better define what constitutes likely "listened to" speech by the child.

### Increased TCDS with age
Another possibility is that speakers more frequently address children who are more communicatively competent [i.e., increased TCDS with age, e.g.,@warlaumont2014social]. In their longitudinal study of Yucatec Mayan children, Shneidman and Goldin-Meadow [-@shneidman2012language] found that TCDS increased significantly with age, though most of the increase came from other children speaking to the target child. Their finding is consistent with other reports that Mayan children are more often cared for by their older siblings from later infancy onward [-@brown2014interactional; -@brown2011cultural]. In our data, there was no evidence for an overall increase in TCDS with age, neither from adult speakers nor from child speakers. This non-increase in TCDS with age may be due to the fact TCDS from other children was overall infrequent in our data, possibly because: (a) the children were relatively young and so spent much of their time with their mothers, (b) these particular children did not have many older siblings, and (c) in the daylong recording context more adults were present to talk to each other than would be typical in a short-format recording [as used in @shneidman2012language]. That aside, we conclude from these findings, that an increase in TCDS with age is also unlikely to explain the robust pattern of Tseltal vocal development.

### Learning during interactional bursts
A third possibility is that children learn effectively from short, routine language encounters. Bursty input appears to be the norm across a number of linguistic and interactive scales [e.g., @abney2017time; @blasiIPhuman], and experiment-based work suggests that children can benefit from massed presentation of new information [@schwab2016repetition]. We propose two mechanisms through which Tseltal children might capitalize on the distribution of speech input in their environment: (a) they experience most language input during routine activities and (b) they consolidate their language experiences during the downtime between interactive peaks. Neither of these mechanisms are proposed to be particular to Tseltal children, but might be employed to explain their efficient learning.

Tseltal children's linguistic input is not uniformly distributed over the day: children were most likely to encounter speech, particularly directed, contingent speech in the mornings and late afternoons, compared to midday. Older children, who are less often carried and were therefore more free to seek out interactions, showed these time of day effects most strongly, eliciting TCDS both in the mornings (when the entire household is present) and around midday (when many have dispersed for farming or other work). An afternoon dip in environmental speech, similar to what we report here, has been previously found for North American children's daylong recordings [@greenwood2011assessing; @soderstrom2013when]. The presence of a similar effect in Tseltal suggests that non-uniform distributions of linguistic input may be the norm for children in a variety of different cultural-economic contexts. Our findings here are the first to show that those time of day effects change with age in the first few years across a number of speech environment features (TCDS, TC--O transitions, O--TC transitions, and (marginally) ODS). These time of day effects likely arise from the activities that typically occur in the mornings and late afternoons---meal preparation and dining in particular---while short bouts of sleep could contribute to the afternoon dip [@soderstrom2013when]. That said, in data from North American children [@soderstrom2013when], the highest density speech input came during storytime and organized playtime (e.g., sing-alongs, painting), while mealtime was associated with less speech input. We expect that follow-up research tracking TCDS during activities in the Tseltal data will lead to very different conclusions: storytime and organized playtime are vanishingly rare in this non-child-centric community, and mealtime may represent a time of routine and rich linguistic experience. In both cases, however, the underlying association with activity (not hour) implies a role for action routines that help children optimally extract information about what words, agents, objects, and actions they will encounter and what they are expected to do in response [see, e.g., @bruner1983childs; @tamislemonda2018routine].

A more speculative possibility is that Tseltal children learn language on a natural input-consolidation cycle: the rarity of interactional peaks throughout the day may be complemented by an opportunity to consolidate new information. Sleep has been shown to benefit language learning tasks in both adults [@frost2017sleep; @mirkovic2016does] and children [@horvath2016daytime; @hupbach2009nap; @gomez2006naps], including word learning, phonotactic constraints, and syntactic structure. Our impression, both from the recordings and informal observations made during visits to the community, is that young Tseltal children frequently sleep for short periods throughout the day, particularly at younger ages when they spend much of their day wrapped within the shawl on their mother's back. Mayan children tend to pick their own resting times; there are no formalized "sleep" times, even at bedtime [@morelli1992cultural], and Mayan mothers take special care to keep infants in a calm and soothing environment in the first few months of life [e.g., @deleon2011language; @pye1986quiche]. There is little quantitative data on Mayan children's daytime and nighttime sleeping patterns, but one study estimates that Yucatec Mayan children between 0;0 and 2;0 sleep or rest nearly 15% of the time between morning and evening [@gaskins2000childrens], doing so at times that suited the child [@morelli1992cultural]. If Tseltal children's interactional peaks are bookended by short sleeping periods, it could contribute to efficient consolidation of new information encountered. How often Tseltal children sleep, how deeply, and how their sleeping patterns may relate to their linguistic development is an important topic for future research.

## Limitations and Future Work {#disc-limfut}
The current findings are based on a cross-sectional analysis of 600 annotated recording minutes, divided among only ten children. The data are limited mainly to verbal activity; we cannot analyze gaze and gestural behavior. We have also used overall vocal maturity as an index of language development, but further work should include receptive and productive measures of linguistic skill with both experiment- and questionnaire- based measures, as well as more in-depth analyses of children's spontaneous speech, building on past work [@brown2014interactional; @brown2014language; @brown2011cultural; @brown1998conversational].  In short, more and more diverse data are needed to enrich this initial description of Tseltal children's language environments. Importantly, the current analyses are based on a corpus that is still under active development: as new data are added, up-to-date versions of these analyses will be available with the current data and analysis scripts at: https://retracted_for_review.shinyapps.io/retracted_for_review/<!--https://middycasillas.shinyapps.io/Tseltal_Child_Language_Environment/-->.
<!--To fully understand the extent to which language learning mechanisms are shared across ethnolinguistically diverse samples we cannot simply continue to compare developmental benchmarks. More promising long-term approaches include a focus on how within-community differences and/or cross-linguistic differences for related languages drive variation in learning [e.g., @pye2017comparative; @weisleder2013talking]-->

## Conclusion {#disc-conclusion}
We estimate that, over the course of a waking day, Tseltal children under age 3;0 hear an average of `r round(mean(quantity.rand.bychild$tds_mph),2)` minutes of directed speech per hour. Contingent turn taking tends to occur in sparsely distributed bursts often with a dip in the mid- to late-afternoon, particularly for older children. Tseltal children's vocal maturity is on track with prior estimates from populations in which child-directed speech is much more frequent, raising a challenge for future work: how do Tseltal children efficiently extract information from their linguistic environments? In our view, a promising avenue for continued research is to more closely investigate how directed speech is distributed over activities over the course of the day and to explore a possible input-consolidation cycle for language exposure in early development. By better understanding how Tseltal children learn language, we hope to help uncover how human language learning mechanisms are adaptive to the many thousands of ethnolinguistic environments in which children develop.

<!--Notes and bits of text to hold on to-->
<!--A large meta-analysis of children's sleep across non-industrial and industrialized cultures suggests that between 0;0 and 2;0, children take an average number of 1.7 naps with no differences across the countries compared [@galland2012normal]. At an estimated ~2 hours per nap and assuming an observation window of 12 hours (i.e., morning to evening, as in @gaskins2000childrens), the average proportion of time spent napping during the day is 28% for children from industrialized and non-industrial societies. That is, nearly two times as much sleep as the Mayan children are reported to get. Is that really the case? This needs checking up on :)-->

<!--Morelli and colleagues' -@morelli1992cultural investigation of children's sleep in a Mayan community in Guatemala, suggests that bed-sharing, on-demand breastfeeding, and no bedtime routine (i.e., children fall asleep when they are ready, typically in someone's arms) contributes to a stronger similarity between daytime and nighttime sleep in Mayan children compared to US children. If the Tseltal children are similar, we would expect to see more daytime sleeping (because of shorter night-->

<!--Work on children acquiring Tseltal in this same community has previously suggested somewhat later early vocal development. The in-depth study of two Tseltal children's early language production during longitudinal, short-format, at-home recordings showed that their first intelligible words emerged around 1;6 and their first verbs with an argument (one type of multi-word utterance) appeared at ages 1;10 and 2;1, repsectively [@brown1998childrens; @brown1998early; @brown1997isolating]. That said, low-frequency events, such as first words and first multi-word sequences, are less likely to be captured during short-format naturalistic recordings than they are during daylong recordings. Particularly considering that we include utterances manually selected as the child's most mature vocal activity over the entire day, it is unsurprising that children in the current analysis look slightly more precocious than those studied previously.-->

<!--One serious issue is how we define adult-like linguistic competence, especially within models in which we consider that adults still continue learning and that individual differences are rampant between adults in both linguistic knowledge and skill at every level, from phonetics to syntax to pragmatics, and of course vocabulary too. When we talk about language acquisition, especially cross-culturally, we have to be careful about what we think the "target" is and what are considered to be the developmental benchmarks children achieve. The focus recently has been on vocabulary acquisition, for some of the reasons outline above. However, vocabulary is a particularly literacy-centric view of language development. If we were to go back in time and set the seed of developmental language science in another culture, we might be much more concerned about the acquisition of kinship systems and other complex relational language, or in the ability to design elaborately indirect speech acts. Acquiring a language involves the mastery of a shockingly diverse array of skills and knowledge: not just linguistic symbols and systems, but also the infrastructure underlying their use (e.g., interactional skills), the cognitive-general skills supporting those systems. There's no reason _a priori_ to believe that every aspect of language acquisition is equally influenced by environmental features. For example, children's pointing frequency is influenced by the amount of pointing in their environment, but the age of pointing onset---the age which they first begin to point---appears unaffected by the frequency of pointing in their environment (REFS: Matthews, Liszkowski).-->
