# Full model outputs {#models}
In the main text we only report _significant_ effects on two speech environment variables: TCDS min/hr and ODS min/hr. Here in the Supplementary Materials we give the full model output tables for each analysis, including re-leveled versions of each model to show all three of the two-way contrasts between the three-level time-of-day factor (i.e., morning vs. midday, morning vs. afternoon, and midday vs. afternoon). We also include, for each of the measures, a histogram showing how each variable is distributed (i.e., usually because they are non-normal and/or zero-inflated) and a figure showing the distribution of model residuals. For every negative binomial model, we also include the full model output table and residual plots for a matching gaussian mixed-effects regressions which uses a logged dependent measure. Such gaussian models with logged measures are an alternative solution to analyzing non-normal distributions sometimes used in psycholinguistics, but are not suitable for the current data given how our speech environment measures are distributed, particularly in the randomly sampled clips (see, e.g., Figures [1](#fig1), [7](#fig7), [10](#fig10), [13](#fig13), [19](#fig19)). Overall, however, the gaussian models show a qualitatively similar pattern of results. None of the gaussian model results are presented in the main text---only here as supplementary information.

## How to interpret the model output
All models were run with the glmm-TMB library in R [@R-glmmTMB; @brooks2017modeling]. Note that, in the negative binomial regressions, the dependent variables have been rounded to the nearest integer (e.g., 3.2 minutes of TCDS per hour becomes 3 minutes per hour in the model).

The predictors in the models are abbreviated as follows: tchiyr.std = centered, standardized target child age in months; stthr.tri = the start time of the clip as either morning, midday, or afternoon; hsz.std = centered, standardized household size of the target child; nsk.std = centered, standardized number of speakers present in the clip, aclew_child_id = the unique identifier for each child. The predictors are sometimes combined in two-way interactions, as shown below with a ':' separator between predictor names (e.g., tchiyr.std:nsk.std = a two-way interaction of target child age and number of speakers present).

In each model output table, the "component" shows what kind of model the estimate derives from (e.g., the zero-inflated models include both a conditional "cond" set of predictors, random effects, and zero-inflation "zi" predictors). The "term" is the estimated predictor. The "statistic" is the estimated _z_-statistic for each predictor's effect. The other labels are self-explanatory.

As more data are added to this corpus, the analyses will also be updated, as will this supplementary model information, all of which will be available online at: (URL retracted for review)<!--https://middycasillas.shinyapps.io/Tseltal_Child_Language_Environment/-->.

## Target-child-directed speech (TCDS) {#models-tcds}
### Random clips {#models-tcds-random}
TCDS rate in the random clips demonstrated a skewed distribution with extra cases of zero [Figure 1](#fig1). We therefore modeled it using a zero-inflated negative binomial mixed-effects regression in the main text: results for the two models demonstrating all pairwise effects of time of day are shown in [Table 1](#tab1) and [Table 2](#tab2). The residuals for the default model ([Table 1](#tab1)) are shown in [Figure 2](#fig2).

The residuals for the default gaussian model ([Table 3](#tab3)) are shown in [Figure 3](#fig3).

### Turn-taking clips {#models-tcds-turntaking}
TCDS rate in the turn-taking clips demonstrated a slightly skewed, but unimodal distribution [Figure 4](#fig4). We therefore modeled it using a plain (i.e., non-zero-inflated) negative binomial mixed-effects regression in the main text: results for the two models demonstrating all pairwise effects of time of day are shown in [Table 5](#tab5) and [Table 6](#tab6). The residuals for the default model ([Table 5](#tab5)) are shown in [Figure 5](#fig5).
