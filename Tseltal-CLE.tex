\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

A great deal of work in developmental language science revolves around
one central question: What linguistic evidence (i.e., what types and how
much) is needed to support first language acquisition? In pursuing this
topic, many researchers have fixed their sights on child-directed speech
(CDS), showing that it is linguistically distinctive
(REFS)\textbf{{[}TASK 00: Add missing references{]}}, interactionally
rich (REFS), preferred by infants (REFS), and---perhaps most
importantly---facilitates word learning (REFS). By all appearances, CDS
is an essential component for acquiring a first language. Yet
ethnographic reports from a number of traditional, non-Western
communities suggest that children easily acquire their community's
language(s) with little or no CDS (REFS). If so, CDS may not be
essential for learning language; just useful for facilitating certain
aspects of language development. In this paper we investigate the
language environment and early development of 10 Tseltal Mayan children
growing up in a community where past research has suggested that
caregivers use little CDS with infants and young children (REFS Brown).

\subsection{Child-directed speech}\label{intro-cds}

The amount of CDS children hear influences their language development,
particularly their vocabulary (REFS). For example, \textbf{{[}TASK 01:
Add examples of input-vocab link{]}}. CDS has also been linked to young
children's speed of lexical retrieval (REFS Weisleder; LuCiD) and
syntactic development (REFS Huttenlocher). \textbf{{[}TASK 02: Read
Huttenlocher and add details here{]}}. The conclusion drawn from much of
this work is that CDS is an ideal register for learning
words---especially concrete nouns and verbs---because it is tailored to
maximize a child's moment-to-moment interest and understanding (REFS).
Indeed, even outside of first-person interaction, infants and young
children prefer listening to CDS over adult-directed speech (REFS
ManyBabies, etc.), suggesting that CDS is useful in catching,
maintaining, and focusing children's attention. There are, however, a
few significant caveats to the body of work relating CDS quantity to
language development.

First, while there is overwhelming evidence linking CDS quantity to
vocabulary size, links to grammatical development are more scant (REFS:
Huttenlocher; Frank et al.). While the advantage of CDS for referential
word learning is clear, it is less obvious how CDS facilitates syntactic
learning. \textbf{{[}TASK 03: Add argument from Yurovsky paper +
refrences therein{]}} On the other hand, there is a wealth of evidence
that both children and adults' syntactic knowledge is highly lexically
specified (REFS), and that, crosslinguistically, children's vocabulary
size is one of the most robust predictors of their early syntactic
development (REFS). In short, what is good for the lexicon may also be
good for syntax. For now, however, the link between CDS and other
aspects of grammatical development still needs to be more thoroughly
tested.

A second caveat is that most work on CDS quantity uses summary measures
that average over the ebb and flow of interaction (e.g., proportion
CDS). In both child and adult interactions, verbal behaviors are highly
structured: while some occur at fairly regular intervals
(\enquote{periodic}), others occur in shorter, more intense bouts
separated by long periods of inactivity (\enquote{bursty} REFS Abney
2018 bursts and lulls, see also fusaroli et al. 2014 synergy). For
example, Abney and colleagues (2016 REFS) found that, across multiple
time scales of daylong recordings, both infants' and adults' vocal
behavior was clustered. Focusing on lexical development, Blasi and
colleagues (REFS in prep) also found that nouns and verbs were used
burstily in child-proximal speech across all six of the languages in
their typologically diverse sample. Infrequent words were somewhat more
bursty overall, leading them to propose that burstiness may play a key
and universal role in acquiring otherwise-rare linguistic units (see
also REFS in prep from
ICIS).\footnote{But see Drew and Bergelson (REFS in preparation), who find that the highest-frequency nouns used in CDS and children's own speech were relatively more bursty than other nouns.}
Experiment-based work also shows that two-year-olds learn novel words
better from a massed presentation of object labels versus a distributed
presentation (Schwab and Lew-Williams (2016) REFS; but see REFS Ambridge
et al., 2006; Childers and Tomasello, 2002). Structured temporal
characteristics in children's language experience imply new roles for
attention and memory in language development. By that token, we should
begin to investigate the link between CDS and linguistic development
with more nuanced measures of how CDS is distributed.

Finally, prior work has typically focused on Western (primarily North
American) populations, limiting our ability to generalize these effects
to children acquiring language worldwide (REFS: WEIRD; Lieven, 1994).
While we do gain valuable insight by looking at \emph{within-population}
variation (e.g., REFS), we can more effectively find places where our
assumptions break down by studying \emph{new} populations. Linguistic
anthropologists working in non-Western communities have long reported
that caregiver interaction styles vary immensely from place to place,
with some caregivers using little or no CDS to young children (REFS
Gaskins, 2006). Children in these communities reportedly acquire
language with \enquote{typical}-looking benchmarks. For example, they
start pointing (REFS Liszkowski et al., 2012; but see Salomo \&
Liszkowski, 2013) and talking (REFS Rogoff et al., 2003?; Brown??)
around the same time we would expect for Western middle-class infants.
These findings have had little impact on mainstream theories of word
learning and language acquisition, partly due to a lack of directly
comparable measures (Brown, 2014). If, however, these children indeed
acquire language without delay despite little or no CDS, we must
reconsider what kind of linguistic evidence is necessary for children to
learn language.

\subsection{Language development in non-WEIRD
communities}\label{intro-nonweird}

To our knowledge, only a handful of researchers have used methods from
developmental psycholinguistics to describe the language environments
and linguistic development of children growing up in traditional,
non-Western communities. We briefly highlight two recent efforts along
these lines, but see Mastin and Vogt (REFS 2016) and Cristia et al.
(2017) for more examples.

Scaff, Cristia, and colleagues (REFS 2017; in preparation) have used a
number of methods to estimate how much speech children hear in a Tsimane
forager-horticulturalist population in the Bolivian lowlands. Their
daylong recordings show that Tsimane children between 0;6 and 6;0 hear
\textasciitilde{}5 minutes of CDS per hour, regardless of their age (but
see Cristia et al., 2017). For comparison, children from North American
homes between ages 0;3 and 3;0 are estimated to hear \textasciitilde{}11
minutes of CDS per hour in daylong recordings (REFS: Bergelson,
Casillas, et al., see also REFS the newer Tamis-LeMonda paper; maybe
give estimates w/ age ranges for each??). Tsimane children also hear
\textasciitilde{}10 minutes of other-directed speech per hour (e.g.,
talk between adults) compared to the \textasciitilde{}7 minutes per hour
heard by North American children (REFS Bergelson, Casillas, et al.).
This difference may be attributable to the fact that the Tsimane live in
extended family clusters of 3--4 households, so speakers are typically
in close proximity to 5--8 other people (REFS Cristia et al., 2017).

Laura Shneidman and colleagues (REFS; 2010; 2012) analyzed speech from
1-hour at-home video recordings of children between ages 1;0 and 3;0 in
two communities: Yucatec Mayan (Southern Mexico) and North American (a
major U.S. city). Their analyses yielded four main findings: compared to
the American children, (a) the Yucatec children heard many fewer
utterances per hour, (b) a much smaller proportion of the utterances
they heard were \emph{child-directed}, (c) the proportion of utterances
that were child-directed increased dramatically with age, matching U.S.
children's by 3;0 months, and (d) most of the added CDS came from other
children (e.g., older siblings and cousins). They also demonstrated that
the lexical diversity of the CDS they hear at 24 months---particularly
from adult speakers---predicted children's vocabulary knowledge at 35
months.

These groundbreaking studies establish a number of important findings:
First, children in each of these communities appear able to acquire
their languages with relatively little CDS. Second, CDS might become
more frequent as children get older, though this could largely be due to
speech from other children. Finally, despite these differences, CDS from
adults may still be the most robust predictor of vocabulary growth.

\subsection{The current study}\label{intro-currentstudy}

We examine the early language experience of 10 Tseltal Mayan children
under age 3;0. Prior ethnographic work suggests that Tseltal caregivers
do not frequently speak directly to their children until the children
themselves begin speaking (REFS: Brown??). Nonetheless, Tseltal children
develop language with no apparent delays. Tseltal Mayan language and
culture has much in common with the Yucatec Mayan communities Shneidman
reports on (REFS: 2010 + add other stuff that's not nec lg), allowing us
to compare differences in child language environments between the two
sites more directly than before.\textbackslash{}footnote\{For a review
of comparative work on language socialization in Mayan cultures, see Pye
(2017).) We provide more details on this community and dataset in the
\protect\hyperlink{methods}{Methods section}.

Similar to previous work, we estimated how much speech children
overheard, how much was directed to them, and how those quantities
changed with age. To this foundation we added new sampling techniques
for investigating variability in children's speech environments within
daylong recordings. We also analyzed children's early vocal productions,
examining both the overall developmental trajectory of their vocal
maturity and how their vocalizations are influenced by CDS.

Based on prior work, we predicted that Tseltal Mayan children hear
little CDS, that the amount of CDS they hear increases with age, that
most CDS comes from other children, and that, despite this, Tseltal
Mayan children reach speech production benchmarks on par with Western
children. We additionally predicted that children's language
environments would be bursty---that brief, high-intensity interactions
would be sparsely distributed throughout the day, accounting for the
majority of children's daily CDS---and that children's responsiveness
and vocal maturity would be maximized during these moments of
high-intensity interaction.

\hypertarget{methods}{\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\subsection{Community}\label{methods-community}

The children in our dataset (REFS: Casillas HomeBank) come from a
small-scale, subsistence farming community in the highlands of Chiapas
in Southern Mexico. The vast majority of children grow up speaking
Tseltal monolingually at home. Primary school is conducted in Tseltal,
but secondary and further education is primarily conducted in Spanish.
Nuclear families are often large (5+ children) and live in patrilineal
clusters. Nearly all families grow staple crops such as corn and beans,
but also bananas, chilies, squash, coffee, and more. Household and
farming work is divided among men, women, and older children. Women do
much of the daily cleaning and food preparation, but also frequently
work in the garden, haul water and firewood, and do other physical
labor. A few community members---both men and women---earn incomes as
teachers and shopkeepers but are still expected to regularly contribute
to their family's household work.

More than forty years of ethnographic work by the second author has
reported that Tseltal children's language environments are
non-child-centered and non-object-centered (REFS). During their waking
hours, Tseltal infants are typically tied to their mother's back while
she goes about her work for the day. Infants receive very little direct
speech until they themselves begin to initiate interactions, usually as
they approach their first birthdays. Even then, interactional exchanges
are often brief or non-verbal (e.g., object exchange routines) and take
place within a multi-participant context (Brown 2011; 2014). Rarely is
attention given to words and their meanings, even when objects are
central to the activity. Instead, interactions tend to focus on
appropriate actions and responses, and young children are socialized to
attend to the interactions taking place around them (REFS see also
Rogoff and de Leon).

Young children are often cared for by other family members, especially
older siblings. Even when not on their mother's back, infants are rarely
put on the ground, so they can't usually pick up the objects around them
until they are old enough to walk. Toys are scarce and books are
vanishingly rare, so the objects children do get their hands on tend to
be natural or household objects (e.g., rocks, sticks, spoons, baskets,
etc.). By age five, most children are competent speakers who engage
daily in chores and caregiving of their younger siblings. The Tseltal
approach to caregiving is similar to that described for other Mayan
communities (e.g., REFS Rogoff, Gaskins, de Leon, Shneidman).

\subsection{Corpus}\label{methods-corpus}

The current data come from the Casillas HomeBank Corpus (REFS HomeBank),
which includes daylong recordings and other developmental language data
from more than 100 children under 4;0 across two indigenous, non-WEIRD
communities: the Tseltal Mayan community described here and a Papua New
Guinean community described elsewhere (REFS).

\emph{{[}TASK 06: Check these demographic data again{]}} The Tseltal
data, primarily collected in 2015, include recordings from 55 children
born to 43 mothers. The families in our dataset typically only had 2--3
children (median = 2; range = 1--9), due to the fact that the
participating families come from a young subsample of the community
(mothers: mean = 26.9 years; median = 25.9; range = 16.6--43.8 and
fathers: mean = 30.5; median = 27.6; range = 17.7---52.9). On average,
mothers were 20.1 years old when they had their first child (median =
19; range = 12--27), with a following inter-child interval of 3.04 years
(median = 2.8; range =
1--8.5).\footnote{These estimates do not include miscarriages and/or children who passed away.}.
As a result, 26\% of the participating families had two children under
4;0.

Extended households, defined in our dataset as the group sharing a
kitchen or other primary living space, ranged between between 3 and 15
people (mean = NN; median = NN). Although 30.9\% of the target children
are first-born, they were rarely the only child in their extended
household. Caregiver education is one (imperfect) measure of contact
with Western culture. Most mothers had finished primary school, with
many also having completed secondary school (range = no
schooling--university). Most fathers had finished secondary school, with
many having also completed preparatory school (range = no
schooling--university). Owing in large part to patrilineal (i.e., father
to son) land inheritance, 93\% of the fathers grew up in the village
where the recordings took place, while only 53\% of the mothers did.

\subsubsection{Recordings}\label{methods-corpus-recs}

Methods for estimating the quantity of speech that children hear have
advanced significantly in the past two decades, with long-format at-home
audio recordings quickly becoming the new standard (e.g., with the
LENA\textsuperscript{Â®} system; REFS). These recordings capture a wider
range of the linguistic patterns children hear as they participate in
different activities with different speakers over the course of their
day. In longer, more naturalistic recordings, caregivers also tend to
use less CDS (REFS Tamis-LeMonda). The result is greater confidence that
the estimated CDS characteristics are representative of what the child
typically hears at home.

We used a novel combination of a lightweight stereo audio recorder
(Olympus\textsuperscript{Â®} WS-832) and wearable photo camera (Narrative
Clip 1\textsuperscript{Â®}) fitted with a fish-eye lens, to track
children's movements and interactions over the course of a 9--11-hour
period in which the experimenter was not present. Each recording was
made during a single day at home in which the recorder and/or camera was
attached to the child. Ambulatory children wore both devices on an
elastic vest. Non-ambulatory children wore the recorder in a onesie
while their primary caregiver wore the camera on an elastic vest
\emph{Figure 1} \emph{{[}TASK 07: Make figure{]}}. The camera was set to
take photos at 30-second intervals and was synchronized to the audio in
post-processing to create video of the child's daylong
recording.\footnote{Documentation for recording set-up and scripts for post-processing are available at *[TASK 08: Link to relevant docs]*}

\subsection{Data selection and annotation}\label{methods-samples}

We annotated video clips from 10 of the 55 children's recordings. We
chose these 10 recordings to maximize variance in three demographic
variables: child age (0--3;0), child sex, and maternal education. The
sample is summarized in \emph{Table 1} \emph{{[}TASK 09: Make table{]}}.
We then selected one hour's worth of non-overlapping clips from each
recording in the following order: nine randomly selected 5-minute clips,
five 1-minute clips manually selected as the top \enquote{turn-taking}
minutes of the recording, five 1-minute clips manually selected as the
top \enquote{vocal activity} minutes of the recording, and one, manually
selected 5-minute extension of the best 1-minute sample \emph{FIGURE ??}
\emph{{[}TASK 10: Add figure of recording times with samples highlighted
for the 10 recs{]}}. We created these different subsamples of each day
to measure properties of (a) children's \emph{average} language
environments (random samples) and (b) their \emph{most input-dense}
language environments (turn-taking samples). The third sample
(high-activity) gave us insight into children's productive speech
abilities.

The turn-taking and high-activity clips were chosen by two trained
annotators (the first author and a student assistant) who listened to
each recording in its entirety at 1--2x speed while actively taking
notes about potentially useful clips. Afterwards, the first author
reviewed the list of candidate clips, listened again to each one (at 1x
speed, multiple repetitions), and chose the best five 1-minute samples
for each of the two types of activity. Good turn-taking activity was
defined as at closely timed sequences of contingent vocalization between
the target child and at least one other person (i.e., frequent
vocalization exchanges). The \enquote{best} turn-taking clips were
chosen because they had the most and most clear turn-switching activity
between the target child and the other speaker(s). Good vocal activity
clips were defined as clips in which the target child produced the most
and most diverse spontaneous (i.e., not imitative) vocalizations. The
\enquote{best} vocal activity clips were chosen for representing the
most linguistically mature and/or diverse vocalizations made by the
child over the day. All else being equal, candidate clips were
prioritized when they contained less background noise or featured
speakers and speech that were not otherwise frequently represented
(e.g., CDS from older males). The best turn-taking clips and vocal
activity clips often overlapped; turn-taking clips were selected from
the list of candidates first, and then vocal-activity clips were chosen
from the remainder.

\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig0-1.pdf} Each video
clip was transcribed and annotated in ELAN (REFS) using the ACLEW
Annotation Scheme (REFS) by the first author and a native speaker of
Tseltal who lives in the community and knows most of the recorded
families personally. At the time of writing, NN\% \emph{{[}TASK XX: Fill
in before submitting{]}} of the clips have been reviewed by a second
native Tseltal speaker. The annotations include the transcription of
(nearly) all hearable utterances in Tseltal, a loose translation of each
utterance into Spanish, vocal maturity measures of each target child
utterance (non-linguistic vocalizations/non-canonical babbling/non-word
canonical babbling/single words/multiple words), and addressee
annotations for all non-target-child utterances
(target-child-directed/other-child-directed/adult-directed/adult-and-child-directed/animal-directed/other-speaker-type-directed).\footnote{Full documentation, including training materials, for the ACLEW Annotation Scheme can be found at *[TASK 11: Add OSF link]*.}

\subsubsection{Why vocal maturity?}\label{why-vocal-maturity}

\emph{{[}TASK 12: Missing paragraph!!{]}}

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{methods-analysisinfo}

We exported each ELAN file as tab-separated values and then the
annotations into R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) for analysis (plots:
ggplot2; analyses: lme4 and betareg \emph{{[}TASK 13: Fix references to
packages and their citations{]}}). We then calculated a number of
summary variables to characterize children's language environments and
linguistic development including: the rate of all overheard speech
(\enquote{XDS}) and all speech directed to the target child
(\enquote{TCDS}) in both minutes per hour and utterances per hour, the
proportion of speech in TCDS and coming from adult vs.~child speakers,
the rate of target-child-to-other and other-to-target-child turn
transitions, the rate of vocalization produced by the target child, and
the average maturity of children's vocalizations. Using language
environment measures from the turn-taking sample, we then also estimated
the number of intensive interaction minutes each child experienced over
the day.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Speech quantity}\label{speech-quantity}

How much speech do Tseltal children hear overall and what proportion of
that speech is directed to them? For maximum comparability with prior
work we first limit direct comparisons to the randomly sampled Tseltal
clips. During randomly sampled clips, Tseltal children heard an average
of 24.68 minutes of speech per hour (median = 20.12; range =
8.23--48.60), of which an average of 3.63 minutes were directed toward
the target child (median = 4.08; range = 0.83--6.55). Consequently, the
mean proportion of speech directed to children was 0.29 (median = 0.28;
range = 0.05--0.77). By-child estimates of the overheard speech
(other-directed speech; \enquote{ODS}) rate, target-child-directed
speech (\enquote{TCDS}) rate, proportion TCDS (TCDS/(TCDS+ODS)), and
TCDS rate from adult vs.~child caregivers are shown in
\protect\hyperlink{fig1}{figure 1}. To these figures we have added
estimates from prior work with other
communities.\footnote{The Yucatec Mayan data from Shneidman and colleagues was originally reported in utterances per hour. We convert their estimates to minutes per hour using the median utterance duration in our dataset for all non-target child speakers (1029ms)}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig1-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig1}By-child estimates of minutes per hour of overheard
speech (upper left), target-child-directed speech (upper right),
proportion of speech that is directed to the target child (lower left),
and number of speakers present (lower right). Data are shown for the
random (purple; solid) and turn taking (green; dashed) samples. Bands on
the solid linear trends show 95\% CIs.}
\end{figure}

We modeled these measures for the nine clips from each child using
mixed-effects regression using the glmmTMB package in R (REF). Notably,
gaussian linear regression is not appropriate for any of our measures .
The rate-based dependent variables (ODS min/hr and TCDS min/hr) are
continuous with a zero-inflated positive distribution, the proportion
TCDS variable (TCDS/(TCDS+ODS)) is doubly-bounded, and the number of
speakers is count data (i.e., non-negative and non-continuous).

To address this issue for the rate variables (ODS and TDS min/hr),
employed zero-inflated negative binomial regression, which works on
integer values, by rounded each rate estimate down to nearest minute per
hour (ZINB). ZINB regressions model the dependent variable in two ways:
(1) a binomial (\enquote{zero-inflation}) model that evaluates the
likelihood that a datapoint is zero or non-zero and (2) a negative
binomial (\enquote{conditional}) model of all the non-zero datapoints
(REF). For proportion TCDS we used beta regression, which is suited to
making predictions on doubly-bounded data. For number of speakers we
used poisson regression, which is suited to non-negative (often skewed)
integer-based continuous distributions (for more details see Smithson
REFS).

Our primary predictors were as follows: child age, household size, and
number of non-target-child speakers present in that clip (all centered
and standardized), plus maternal education (pre-secondary
vs.~secondary-plus)\footnote{Spanish-only education begins in secondary school.},
and squared time of day at the start of the clip (in decimal hours;
centered on noon and standardized). We used squared time of day to model
the cycle of activity at home: mealtimes in the mornings and evenings
should be more similar to each other than the afternoon because of
dispersal for chores. To this we also added two-way interactions between
child age and maternal education, number of speakers, household size,
and time of day. Finally, we included a random effect of child, with
random slopes of time of day, unless doing so resulted in model
non-convergence. Finally, for the zero-inflation models of
zero-vs-nonzero ODS and TDS rate, we included household size, number of
speakers present, and time of day, with interactions between time of day
and household size and time of day and number of speakers present. The
zero-inflation models used the same random effects structure as their
complementary conditional models. We often had to reduce the fixed
effects structure in the zero-inflation model to achieve convergence, as
detailed below.

The quantity of other-directed speech (ODS) was primarily affected by
the number of speakers present (MODEL-REF): more speakers was associated
with more overheard speech. ODS was also significantly affected by time
of day, being more frequent in the mornings and evenings than around
midday (MODEL-REF). ODS was also more frequent in large households for
older children compared to younger children (MODEL-REF). There was no
significant effect of child age overall, and no effect involving
maternal education. The zero-inflation model of ODS included fixed
effects of household size, time of day, and their interaction, but none
of these predictors were significant.

The quantity of target-directed speech (TCDS) was primarily affected by
factors relating to the child's age. To begin with, older children heard
more TCDS than younger children in general (MODEL-REF). While the
presence of more speakers was associated with less TCDS overall
(MODEL-REF), older children were less affected than younger children by
the increased number of speakers (MODEL-REF). Older children were also
more likely than younger children to hear the most TCDS around midday,
compared to the mornings and evenings (MODEL-REF). While there was no
overall effect of maternal education, children with mothers who did not
complete secondary school heard a greater increase in TCDS with age
compared to children whose mothers had gone to school for longer
(MODEL-REF). The zero-inflation model of TCDS also showed a significant
effect of time of day and a significant interaction between time of day
and household size; TCDS was overall more likely to be present in the
mornings and evenings (MODEL-REF), though this effect was smaller in
large households (MODEL-REF).

As reviewed above, previous work on Mayan communities, including the
Tseltal community suggests that Mayan children hear much of their TCDS
from other children, and that the proportion of TCDS from other children
increases with age (REFS). In order to analyze the effect speaker age
(child or adult TCDS) together with the other predictors modeled above,
we split the data into TCDS from adults and children. All other
predictors remained the same, only the number of speakers present
represented the number of speakers of the relevant type for that
datapoint (i.e., TCDS rate from adults in clip 1 given the number of
adult speakers present in clip 1).

TCDS rates were strongly affected by the age of the speaker: in contrast
to prior work, these data show that most TCDS comes from adults
(MODEL-REF). This speaker age effect depends on how many speakers there
are of each type: while TCDS form children is more likely when more
children are present, adults do not show a similar effect (MODEL-REF).
Finally, children with mothers who had continued to secondary school and
beyond heard less TCDS overall (MODEL-REF). The zero-inflation model of
TCDS from adults and children included fixed effects of household size,
time of day, and their interaction, but only one effect was significant:
as before, TCDS was more likely overall in the mornings and evenings,
compared to midday (MODEL-REF).

Lastly, the overall proportion of speech directed to the child
(proportion TCDS) decreased when more speakers were present (MODEL-REF).
There were no significant overall effects of age, time of day, maternal
education, or household size on the proportion of TCDS used.

\subsubsection{Speech quantity during peak
moments}\label{speech-quantity-during-peak-moments}

Children's linguistic experiences are bursty (REFS) and, as we have
seen, speech is distributed asymetrically throughout the day in Tseltal
children's environments. If, for example, children do most of their
language learning for the day during these short bouts of interaction,
it may be more useful to characterize their learning environment with
respect to the interactional periods---what kinds of speech do they hear
during interaction?---rather than averaging over the entire day. We
therefore repeat the same set of analyses with the turn-taking subset of
the child's data: ODS rate, TCDS rate, TCDS rate by speaker age, and
proportion TCDS.

During high turn-taking clips, Tseltal children heard an average of
25.21 minutes of speech per hour (median = 23.99; range = 12.94--38.29),
of which an average of 13.28 minutes were directed toward the target
child (median = 13.65; range = 7.32--20.19). Consequently, the mean
proportion of speech directed to children was 0.62 (median = 0.62; range
= 0.37--0.93).

Using the same approach as before, we modeled the four speech quantity
measures for the 5--6 turn-taking
clips\footnote{The turn-taking clips included in this analysis are: the five 1-minute turn-taking clips and also the 5-minute 'extension' clip for that recording if it was an extension of a turn-taking clip}
from each recording.

As in the random sample, when more speakers were present, ODS was
significantly more frequent (MODEL-REF). There was no significant
effects of time of day or household size on the rate of ODS in the
turn-taking sample. The zero-inflation model included fixed effects of
household size, time of day, and their interaction, but none of these
predictors were significant.

The only significant factor affecting TCDS quantity in the turn-taking
sample was a two-way interaction between child age and time of day
(MODEL-REF). As before, younger children were more likely to hear TCDS
in the mornings and evenings, whereas older children were more likely to
hear more TCDS midday (MODEL-REF). Unlike the random sample, this
turn-taking sample showed no main effect of child age: older and younger
children heard comparable amounts of TCDS overall. There were also no
significant interactions involving the number of speakers present or
maternal education, like there were in the random sample. The
zero-inflation model included fixed effects of household size, time of
day, and number of speakers but, unlike the model of TCDS in random
clips, none of these predictors significantly influenced the presence of
TCDS in the turn-taking clips.

The model of TCDS quantity by speaker age for the turn-taking sample
showed some similar results to the random sample. First, the quantity of
TCDS in the turn-taking sample was strongly affected by speaker age
(MODEL-REF): most TCDS still came from adults. Second, the presence of
more children increased the quantity of TCDS from children more than the
presence of more adults increased the quantity of TCDS from adults
(MODEL-REF). TCDS quantity by speaker in the turn taking data
additionally showed the time of day effect reported above: TCDS was
maximized during turn-taking bouts that took place in the mornings and
evenings for younger children, but less so for older children
(MODEL-REF). There was also a significant effect of number of speakers:
more speakers was associated with less TCDS (MODEL-REF). Lastly, there
was an interaction between child age and speaker age: while adults were
more likely to use TCDS overall, the increase in TCDS associated with
older children was stronger for TCDS from other children compared to
TCDS from adults (MODEL-REF), similar to the age effect found by
Shneidman and Goldin-Meadow (REFS). The zero-inflation model of TCDS
from adults and children included fixed effects of household size, time
of day, and their interaction, but none of these predictors were
significant.

As in the random sample, the overall proportion of speech directed to
the child (proportion TCDS) decreased when more speakers were present
(MODEL-REF). There were no other significant predictors of proportion of
speech in TCDS.

\subsection{Interactional exchanges}\label{interactional-exchanges}

In the preceding section we measured children's linguistic environments
by the sheer quantity of speech they enounter: both overheard and
directed to them. We can also measure children's linguistic environments
as a summary of the interactional exchanges they partake in (see also
Romeo REFS). When children are jointly engaged with an interlocutor,
they can practice making contingent vocalizations, and both the child
and the interlocutor can more easily coordinate their behaviors and
social and communicative intentions. In what follows, we characterize
children's interactional exchanges with four measures: the rate of
child-to-other turn transitions (i.e., contingent responses to the
child's vocalizations), the rate of other-to-child turn transitions
(i.e., contingent responses by the child), the duration of interactional
turn-taking sequences involving the target child, and the ratio of
interlocutor vs.~child vocalization time. We first describe these
measures with respect to the random sample then, for comparison, we
examine the turn-taking sample.

\subsubsection{Temporal contingency and interactional
sequences}\label{temporal-contingency-and-interactional-sequences}

We detect contingent turn exchanges between the target child and other
speakers based on turn timing (). If there is a target-child-directed
utterance that begins between the start of a target child vocalization
and 2000msec after the end of the child's vocalization, we count it as a
CHI-OTH turn transition Similarly, if there is a target child
vocalization that begins between the start of a target-child-directed
utterance and 2000msec after the end of the utterance, it is counted as
a OTH-CHI turn transition. Each utterance is maximally allowed to act as
one prompt for a child vocalization and one response to a child
vocalization (e.g., in an CHI--OTH--CHI turn-taking sequence). We
identify sequences of interaction using a similar mechanism: we look for
chains of contingent responses before and after each child vocalization,
allowing for speakers to continue with multiple vocalizations/utterances
between speaker exchanges (). In this case, we also limit the overlap
between utterances because we are focused here on interactional exchange
that primarily features speech by one speaker at a time. Sequences are
bounded by the earliest and latest vocalization for which there is no
contingent prompt/response, respectively. Sequences must have at least
one contingent non-target-child utterance. Finally, each child
vocalization can only appear in one sequence, and many sequences have
more than one child vocalization.

We base these timing restrictions on vocal contingency on prior studyes
of infant and young children's turn taking. Hilbrink et al. (2015; REFS)
found that infants' (0;3--1;6) responses to mothers typically began
between -700ms and 1200ms relative to the end of the mothers' turns and
mothers' responses to their infants began between -350ms and 650ms
relative to the end of the infants' turns. Casillas et al. (2016; REFS)
found that children's responses to caregivers' questions typically
started between -500ms and 650ms relative to their caregiver's turn end,
and caregivers' responses to children's question between -1000ms and
400ms relative to the children's turn end. Because both studies focused
on fairly intensive bouts of interaction, and both within WEIRD parental
contexts, we defined contingent responses in the current data with more
generous allowances for overlap and gap (gap = 2000; overlap = 1000).
That said, our timing restrictions are much tighter than those used to
define interactional contingency in many other studies (e.g., REFS, see
also REFS for a review on adult-adult turn timing).

During the randomly selected clips, Tseltal children responded
contingently to others' target-child vocalizations at an average rate of
1.17 responses per minute (median = 0.20; range = 0--8.80). Meanwhile,
other speakers responded contingently to the target children's
vozalizations at an average rate of 1.38 responses per minute (median =
0.40; range = 0--8.60). We detected 602 interactional sequences in the
90 clips, with an average sequence duration of 5.76 seconds (median =
4.30; range = 0.46--48.35). The average number of child vocalizations
was 1.54 (range = 1--10; median = 1). Finally, we computed the
normalized ratio of child vocalization time to target-child-directed
vocalization time, finding that, overall, children vocalized for more
time than their interlocutors, ranging from -0.17 to 0.78 (mean = 0.22,
median = 0.24) by child.

than their interlocutor; 0 = vice versa). Data are shown for the random
(purple; solid) and turn taking (green; dashed) samples. Bands on the
solid linear trends show 95\% CIs}
\end{figure}

As in the preceding set of analyses, gaussian linear regression was not
appropriate for any of the four interaction measures. We again used
zero-inflated negative binomial regression for the rate-based dependent
variables (OTH-CHI and CHI-OTH turn transitions per minute), poisson
regression for sequence duration (a non-negative integer-based
continuous variable), and beta regression for normalized vocalization
difference (a doubly-bounded variable).

Our primary predictors were the same as before: child age, household
size, and number of non-target-child speakers present in that clip (all
centered and standardized), maternal education (pre-secondary
vs.~secondary-plus), and squared time of day at the start of the clip
(in decimal hours; centered on noon and standardized), plus two-way
interactions between child age and maternal education, number of
speakers, household size, and time of day, and a random effect of child,
with random slopes of time of day, unless doing so resulted in model
non-convergence. Because sequences are nested within clips, we also
included a random effect of sequence in the model of sequence duration.
Finally, for the zero-inflation models, we included household size,
number of speakers present, and time of day, with interactions between
time of day and household size and time of day and number of speakers
present, as allowed by model convergence, as before.

The rate at which children hear contingent response from others (CHI-OTH
turn transitions per minute) was primarily influenced by factors
relating to the child's age. Overall, older children heard more
contingent responses then younger children (MODEL-REF), particularly
when there were more speakers present (MODEL-REF). As with the speech
quantity measures, younger children heard more contingent responses in
the mornings and evenings while older children were more likely to hear
more contingent responses midday (MODEL-REF). The zero-inflation model
of contingent responses from others included household size, number of
speakers present, and squared time of day, with two-way interactions of
squared time of day with both household size and number of speakers
present. Of these, the only significant factor predicting the presence
of contingent responses was time of day: contingent responses from
others were more likely overall in the mornings and evenings, compared
to the afternoons (MODEL-REF).

The rate at which children respond contingently to others (OTH-CHI turn
transitions per minute) was similarly influenced by child age and time
of day. Overall, older children gave more contingent responses then
younger children (MODEL-REF). Again, older children were also more
likely to give contingent responses around midday, compared to younger
children, who were more likely to respond in the mornings and evenings
(MODEL-REF). The zero-inflation model of contingent responses from
others included household size, number of speakers present, and squared
time of day, with two-way interactions of squared time of day with both
household size and number of speakers present. None of these predictors
significantly impacted the likelihood of a child giving a contingent
response.

The only factor to significantly impact the duration of interactional
sequences was whether the child's mother completed secondary or further
education (MODEL-REF). Similarly, the normalized ratio of time spent
vocalizing (CHI:OTH) was higher for children of mothers who had
completed secondary or further education (MODEL-REF) and was lower when
more speakers were present (MODEL-REF).

\subsubsection{Interactional exchanges during peak
moments}\label{interactional-exchanges-during-peak-moments}

During the turn taking clips, Tseltal children responded contingently to
others' target-child vocalizations at an average rate of 7.56 responses
per minute (median = 6.20; range = 0--26). Meanwhile, other speakers
responded contingently to the target children's vozalizations at an
average rate of 7.73 responses per minute (median = 7.80; range =
0--25). We detected 511 interactional sequences in the 59 clips, with an
average sequence duration of 6.61 seconds (median = 4.58; range =
0.55--45.47). The average number of child vocalizations was 1.97 (range
= 1--16; median = 1). Finally, we computed the normalized ratio of child
vocalization time to target-child-directed vocalization time, finding
that, overall, children vocalized for more time than their
interlocutors, ranging from -0.16 to 0.37 (mean = 0.08, median = 0.13)
by child.

The rate at which children hear contingent response from others in the
high turn-taking samples was influenced by maternal education, the
number of speakers present, and the time of day. Children of mothers who
completed secondary or further education heard a higher rate of
contingent responses (MODEL-REF). Contingent responses from others were
also less frequent when more speakers were present (MODEL-REF). Finally,
as before, contingent responses from other were more likely in the
mornings and afternoons for younger children, as compared to older
children (MODEL-REF). The zero-inflation model included household size,
squared time of day, and their interaction, none of which significantly
predicted the presence of contingent responses from others.

The rate at which children respond contingently to others was influenced
by maternal education and the number of speakers present. Contingent
responses from the target child were more likely from children whose
mothers had completed secondary or further education (MODEL-REF) and
less likely when more speakers were present (MODEL-REF). The
zero-inflation model included household size, squared time of day, and
their interaction. None of these predictors significantly impacted the
likelihood of the child giving a contingent response.

The duration of interactional sequences in the turn-taking sample was
influenced by a multiple factors, most of which relate to the child's
age. Sequences were slightly shorter for older children (MODEL-REF) and
for children in large households (MODEL-REF), with a significant
interaction between the two such that large households showed a larger
decrease in sequence duration (MODEL-REF). That said, children of
mothers who continued with secondary and further education participated
in longer interactional sequences with age, compared to the other
children (MODEL-REF). Finally, younger children were more likely than
older children to experience longer interactional sequences in the
mornings and evenings, compared to midday (MODEL-REF).

Lastly, the normalized ratio of time spent vocalizing (CHI:OTH) in the
turn-taking sample was not significantly impacted by any of the
predictors in the model, including child age, time of day, number of
speakers present, household size, and maternal education.
