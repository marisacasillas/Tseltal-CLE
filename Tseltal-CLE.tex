  \abstract{We analyzed 9--11-hour at-home audio recordings from 10 Tseltal Mayan
children between 0;2 and 3;0 to investigate how often they engaged in
verbal interaction with others and whether their speech environment
changed with age, time of day, household size, and number of speakers
present. We found that Tseltal children are not often directly spoken
to, that most directed speech comes from adults, and that directed
speech does not increase with age. Most of children's directed speech
came in the mornings or early evenings, particularly with younger
children, and high interactional peaks tended to occur in bursts of turn
taking that lasted approximately one minute. With some exceptions, these
findings support previous characterizations of Mayan caregiver-child
talk. An initial analysis of children's vocal development suggests that,
despite relatively little directed speech, these children develop early
language skills on a similar timescale to WEIRD children. Given these
findings, we discuss multiple proposals for how Tseltal children might
be efficient learners.}

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

A great deal of work in developmental language science revolves around
one central question: What linguistic evidence (i.e., what types and how
much) is needed to support first language acquisition? In pursuing this
topic, many researchers have fixed their sights on the quantity and
characteristics of speech addressed to children; that is, speech
designed for young recipients who may have limited attention and
understanding (e.g., Golinkoff, Can, Soderstrom, \& Hirsh-Pasek, 2015;
Hoff, 2006). In several languages, child-directed speech (CDS\footnote{Throughout
  this article, we use \enquote{child-directed speech} and \enquote{CDS}
  in the most literal sense: speech designed for and directed toward a
  child recipient.}) is linguistically accommodated to young listeners
(A. Cristia, 2013; Soderstrom, 2007), interactionally rich (Bruner,
1983; Butterworth, 2003; Estigarribia \& Clark, 2007; Masataka, 2003),
and preferred by infants (Cooper \& Aslin, 1990; ManyBabies
Collaborative, 2017; Segal \& Newman, 2015). In those same linguistic
communities, these properties of CDS have been found to facilitate early
word learning (Cartmill et al., 2013; e.g., Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2015;
Hoff, 2003; Hurtado, Marchman, \& Fernald, 2008; Rowe, 2008; Shneidman
\& Goldin-Meadow, 2012; Shneidman, Arroyo, Levine, \& Goldin-Meadow,
2012; Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013). Yet ethnographic reports from a
number of traditional, non-Western communities suggest that children
easily acquire their community's language(s) even when the children are
infrequently directly addressed (P. Brown, 2011). If so, large
quantities of CDS may not be essential for learning language; just
useful for facilitating certain aspects of language development. In this
paper we investigate the language environment and early development of
10 Tseltal Mayan children growing up in a community where caregivers are
reported to infrequently directly address speech to infants and young
children (P. Brown, 1998b, 2011, 2014).

\subsection{Child-directed speech}\label{intro-cds}

Prior work on CDS in Western contexts has shown that the amount of CDS
children hear influences their language development; more CDS is
associated with larger and faster-growing receptive and productive
vocabularies in young children (e.g., Hart \& Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003;
Hurtado et al., 2008; Peter, Durrant, Bidgood, Pine, \& Rowland, in
preparation; Ramírez-Esparza, García-Sierra, \& Kuhl, 2014, 2017;
Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012; Shneidman et al., 2012; Weisleder \&
Fernald, 2013). CDS has also been linked to young children's speed of
lexical retrieval (Hurtado et al., 2008; but see Peter et al., in
preparation; Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013) and syntactic development
(Huttenlocher, Waterfall, Vasilyeva, Vevea, \& Hedges, 2010). The
conclusion drawn from much of this work is that speech directed to
children is well designed for learning words---especially concrete nouns
and verbs---because it is optimized for a child's attention in the
moment it is spoken. Even outside of first-person interaction, infants
and young children prefer listening to attention-grabbing CDS over
adult-directed speech (ManyBabies Collaborative, 2017). There are,
however, a few significant caveats to the body of work relating CDS
quantity to language development.

First, while there is overwhelming evidence linking CDS quantity to
vocabulary size, links to grammatical development are more scant (e.g.,
Brinchmann, Braeken, \& Lyster, 2019; Frank, Braginsky, Marchman, \&
Yurovsky, in preparation; Huttenlocher et al., 2010). While the
advantage of CDS for referential word learning is clear, it is less
obvious how CDS facilitates syntactic learning. For example, utterance
length (a proxy for syntactic complexity; Wasow, 1997) doesn't appear to
increase with child age (Newport, Gleitman, \& Gleitman, 1977), and
parents may be less likely to directly correct their children's
syntactic errors than their semantic ones (R. Brown, 1977; but see
Chouinard \& Clark, 2003)---even sometimes themselves producing
ungrammatical utterances to make individual words salient to their young
interlocutors (Aslin, Woodward, LaMendola, \& Bever, 1996; see also
Yurovsky, 2018). On the other hand, there is a wealth of evidence that
syntactic knowledge is lexically specified (e.g., Arnold, Wasow, Asudeh,
\& Alrenga, 2004; Goldberg, 2003; Lieven, Pine, \& Baldwin, 1997), and
that, crosslinguistically, children's vocabulary size is one of the most
robust predictors of their early syntactic development (Bates \&
Goodman, 1997; Frank et al., in preparation; Marchman,
Martínez-Sussmann, \& Dale, 2004). In short, what is good for the
lexicon may also be good for syntax. For now, however, the link between
CDS and other aspects of grammatical development still needs to be more
thoroughly tested.

A second caveat is that most work on CDS quantity uses summary measures
that average over the ebb and flow of interaction (e.g., proportion
CDS). In both child and adult interactions, verbal behaviors are highly
structured: while some occur at fairly regular intervals
(\enquote{periodic} ), others occur in shorter, more intense bouts
separated by long periods of inactivity (``bursty'' ; Abney, Dale,
Louwerse, \& Kello, 2018; Fusaroli, Razczaszek-Leonardi, \& Tylén,
2014). For example, Abney and colleagues (2017) found that, across
multiple time scales of daylong recordings, both infants' and adults'
vocal behavior was clustered. Focusing on lexical development, Blasi and
colleagues (in preparation) also found that nouns and verbs were used
burstily in child-proximal speech across all six of the languages in
their typologically diverse sample. Infrequent words were somewhat more
bursty overall, leading them to propose that burstiness may play a key
and universal role in acquiring otherwise-rare linguistic units.
Experiment-based work also shows that two-year-olds learn novel words
better from a massed presentation of object labels versus a distributed
presentation (but see Ambridge, Theakston, Lieven, \& Tomasello, 2006,
and @childers2002two; Schwab \& Lew-Williams, 2016). Structured temporal
characteristics in children's language experience imply new roles for
attention and memory in language development. Ideally, then, we should
be investigating how CDS is distributed over children's daily
experiences (Soderstrom \& Wittebolle, 2013).

Finally, prior work has typically focused on Western (primarily North
American) populations, limiting our ability to generalize these effects
to children acquiring language worldwide (P. Brown \& Gaskins, 2014;
Henrich, Heine, \& Norenzayan, 2010; Lieven, 1994; M. Nielsen, Haun,
Kärtner, \& Legare, 2017). While we do gain valuable insight by looking
at \emph{within-population} variation (e.g., different socioeconomic or
sub-cultures), we can more effectively find places where our assumptions
break down by studying \emph{new} populations. Linguistic
anthropologists working in non-Western communities have long reported
that caregiver interaction styles vary immensely from place to place,
with some caregivers using little child-directed speech with young
children (P. Brown \& Gaskins, 2014; Gaskins, 2006; Lieven, 1994).
Children in these communities reportedly acquire language with
\enquote{typical}-looking benchmarks. For example, they start pointing
and talking around the same time we would expect for Western
middle-class infants (P. Brown, 2011, 2014; P. Brown \& Gaskins, 2014;
Liszkowski, Brown, Callaghan, Takada, \& De Vos, 2012; but see Salomo \&
Liszkowski, 2013). These findings have had little impact on mainstream
theories of word learning and language acquisition, partly due to a lack
of directly comparable measures (P. Brown, 2014; P. Brown \& Gaskins,
2014). If, however, children in these communities indeed acquire
language without delay, despite infrequent CDS, we must reconsider what
kind of linguistic evidence is necessary for children to learn language.

\subsection{Language development in non-WEIRD
communities}\label{intro-nonweird}

A growing number of researchers are using methods from developmental
psycholinguistics to describe the language environments and linguistic
development of children growing up in traditional and/or non-Western
communities (Barrett et al., 2013; Demuth, Moloi, \& Machobane, 2010;
Fortier, Kellier, Fernández Flecha, \& Frank, under review; see also
Ganek, Smyth, Nixon, \& Eriks-Brophy, 2018; Garcia, Roeser, \& Höhle,
2018; Hernik \& Broesch, 2018). We briefly highlight two recent efforts
along these lines, but see Cristia and colleagues' (2017) and Mastin and
Vogt's work (2016; 2015) for similar examples.

Scaff, Cristia, and colleagues (2017; in preparation) have used a number
of methods to estimate how much speech children hear in a Tsimane
forager-horticulturalist population in the Bolivian lowlands. From
daylong audio recordings, they estimate that Tsimane children between
0;6 and 6;0 hear maximally \textasciitilde{}5 minutes of directly
addressed speech per hour, regardless of their age. For comparison,
children from North American homes between ages 0;3 and 3;0 are
estimated to hear \textasciitilde{}11 minutes of CDS per hour in daylong
recordings (Bergelson et al., 2018b). Tsimane children also hear
\textasciitilde{}10 minutes of other-directed speech per hour (e.g.,
talk between adults) compared to the \textasciitilde{}7 minutes per hour
heard by young North American children (Bergelson et al., 2018b). This
difference may be attributable to the fact that the Tsimane live in
extended family clusters of 3--4 households, so speakers are typically
in close proximity to 5--8 other people (A. Cristia et al., 2017).

Shneidman and colleagues (2010; 2012) analyzed speech from one-hour
at-home video recordings of children between ages 1;0 and 3;0 in two
communities: Yucatec Mayan (Southern Mexico) and North American (a major
U.S. city). Their analyses yielded four main findings: compared to the
American children, (a) the Yucatec children heard many fewer utterances
per hour, (b) a much smaller proportion of the utterances they heard
were child-directed, (c) the proportion of utterances that were
child-directed increased dramatically with age, matching U.S. children's
by 3;0 months, and (d) most of the added CDS came from other children
(e.g., older siblings and cousins). They also demonstrated that the
lexical diversity of the CDS they hear at 24 months---particularly from
adult speakers---predicted children's vocabulary knowledge at 35 months.

\subsection{The current study}\label{intro-currentstudy}

We examine the early language experience of 10 Tseltal Mayan children
under age 3;0. Prior ethnographic work suggests that Tseltal caregivers
do not frequently speak directly to their children until the children
themselves begin to actively initiate verbal interactions (P. Brown,
2011, 2014). Nonetheless, Tseltal children develop language with no
apparent delays. Tseltal Mayan language and culture has much in common
with the Yucatec Mayan communities Shneidman reports on, allowing us to
compare differences in child language environments between the two sites
more directly than before.\footnote{For a review of comparative work on
  language socialization in Mayan cultures, see Pye (2017).} We provide
more details on this community and dataset in the
\protect\hyperlink{methods}{Methods section}.

We analyzed basic measures of Tseltal children's language environments
including: (a) the quantity of speech directed to them, (b) the quantity
of other-directed speech they could overhear from nearby speakers, (c)
the rate of contingent responses to their vocalizations, (d) the rate of
their own contingent responses to others' vocalizations, and (e) the
duration of their interactional dyadic sequences. To link these findings
to prior work on speech environment and development, we also rougly
estimated the number of minutes per day they spent in \enquote{high
turn-taking} interaction and outlined a basic trajectory for early vocal
development (i.e., from non-canonical babbles to multi-word utterances).

Based on prior work, we predicted that Tseltal Mayan children are
infrequently directly addressed, that the amount of CDS and contingent
responses they hear increases with age, that most CDS comes from other
children, and that, despite this, their early vocal development is on
par with Western children. We additionally predicted that children's
language environments would be bursty---that high-intensity interactions
would be brief and sparsely distributed throughout the day, accounting
for the majority of children's daily CDS.

\hypertarget{methods}{\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\subsection{Community}\label{methods-community}

The children in our dataset come from a small-scale, subsistence farming
community in the highlands of Chiapas in Southern Mexico. The vast
majority of children grow up speaking Tseltal monolingually at home. The
first few years of primary school are conducted mainly in Tseltal, but
the remainder of primary school, secondary school, and any further
education is conducted exclusively in Spanish. Nuclear families are
often large (5+ children) and live in patrilineal clusters. Nearly all
families grow staple crops such as corn and beans, but also cultivate
bananas, chilies, squash, coffee, and more. Household and farming work
is divided among men, women, and older children. Women do much of the
daily cleaning and food preparation, but also frequently work in the
garden, haul water and/or firewood, and do other physical labor. A few
community members (both men and women) earn incomes as teachers and
shopkeepers but are still expected to regularly contribute to their
family's household work.

More than forty years of ethnographic work by the second author has
supported the idea that Tseltal children's language environments are
non-child-centered and non-object-centered (P. Brown, 1998b, 2011,
2014). During their waking hours, Tseltal infants are typically tied to
their mother's back while she goes about her work for the day. Infants
receive very little direct speech until they themselves begin to
initiate interactions, usually as they approach their first birthdays.
Even then, interactional exchanges are often brief or non-verbal (e.g.,
object exchange routines) and take place within a multi-participant
context (P. Brown, 2014). Rarely is attention given to words and their
meanings, even when objects are central to the activity. Instead,
interactions tend to focus on appropriate actions and responses, and
young children are socialized to attend to the interactions taking place
around them (León, 2000, see also 2011; Rogoff, Paradise, Arauz,
Correa-Chávez, \& Angelillo, 2003). That said, P. Brown (2014) points
out that other language- and culture-specific properties may facilitate
word and language learning, including conversational repetition,
specific verbs, and the centrality of gesture and gaze in learning the
spatial system.

Young children are often cared for by other family members, especially
older siblings. Even when not on their mother's back, infants are rarely
put on the ground. Therefore, children can't usually pick up the objects
around them until they are old enough to walk. Toys are scarce and books
are vanishingly rare, so the objects children do get their hands on tend
to be natural or household objects (e.g., rocks, sticks, spoons,
baskets, etc.). By age five, most children are competent speakers who
engage daily in chores and the caregiving of their younger siblings. The
Tseltal approach to caregiving is similar to that described for other
Mayan communities (Gaskins, 1996, 1999; León, 1998, 2011; Pye, 1986;
Rogoff et al., 1993, 2003; e.g., Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012).

\subsection{Corpus}\label{methods-corpus}

The current data come from the Casillas HomeBank Corpus (Casillas,
Brown, \& Levinson, 2017; VanDam et al., 2016), which includes daylong
recordings and other developmental language data from more than 100
children under 4;0 across two indigenous, non-WEIRD communities: the
Tseltal Mayan community described here and a Papua New Guinean community
described elsewhere (P. Brown, 2011, 2014; P. Brown \& Casillas, in
press).

The Tseltal data, primarily collected in 2015, include recordings from
55 children born to 43 mothers. The families in our dataset typically
only had 2--3 children (median = 2; range = 1--9), due to the fact that
the participating families come from a young subsample of the community
(mothers: mean = 26.3 years; median = 25; range = 16--43 and fathers:
mean = 30; median = 27; range = 17---52). On average, mothers were 20
years old when they had their first child (median = 19; range = 12--27),
with a following inter-child interval of 3 years (median = 2.8; range =
1--8.5).\footnote{These estimates do not include miscarriages or
  children who passed away.}. As a result, 28\% of the participating
families had two children under 4;0. To our knowledge at time of
recording, all children were typically developing. We calculated the
precise age of children based on the birthdates given by their
caregivers, though these ages should be taken with a pinch of salt
because documentation of birthdates is less rigorous than would be
typically expected in Western post-industrial populations. Households
size, defined in our dataset by the number of people sharing a kitchen
or other primary living space, ranged between between 3 and 15 people
(mean = 7.2; median = 7). Although 32.7\% (18/55) of the target children
are first-born, they were rarely the only child in their household. Most
mothers had finished primary (37\%) or secondary (30\%) school, with a
few more having completed preparatory (12\%) or university (2\%; 1
mother); the remainder (23\%) had no schooling or did not complete
primary school. All fathers had finished primary school, with most
completing secondary school (44\%) or preparatory school (21\%), and two
completing a university-level training (5\%). Clan membership influences
marriage and land inheritance such that 93\% of the fathers grew up in
the village where the recordings took place, while only 53\% of the
mothers did.

\subsubsection{Recordings}\label{methods-corpus-recs}

We used a novel combination of a lightweight stereo audio recorder
(Olympus\textsuperscript{®} WS-832) and wearable photo camera (Narrative
Clip 1\textsuperscript{®}) fitted with a fish-eye lens, to track
children's movements and interactions over the course of a 9--11-hour
period in which the experimenter was not present. Each recording was
made during a single day at home in which the recorder and/or camera was
attached to the child. Ambulatory children wore both devices on an
elastic vest (see \protect\hyperlink{fig1}{Figure 1}). Non-ambulatory
children wore the recorder in a onesie while their primary caregiver
wore the camera on an elastic vest. The camera was set to take photos at
30-second intervals and was synchronized to the audio in post-processing
to create a video file featuring the snapshot-linked audio from the
child's recording.\footnote{Documentation and scripts for
  post-processing are available at and
  \url{https://github.com/marisacasillas/Weave}.} We used these
recordings to capture a wider range of the linguistic patterns children
hear as they participate in different activities with different speakers
over the course of their day (Bergelson, Amatuni, Dailey, Koorathota, \&
Tor, 2018a; Greenwood, Thiemann-Bourque, Walker, Buzhardt, \& Gilkerson,
2011; Tamis-LeMonda, Kuchirko, Luo, Escobar, \& Bornstein, 2017).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Data selection and annotation}\label{methods-samples}

We annotated video clips from 10 of the 55 children's recordings. We
chose these 10 recordings to maximize variance in three demographic
variables: child age (0--3;0), child sex, and maternal education. The
sample is summarized in \protect\hyperlink{tab1}{Table 1}. We then
selected one hour's worth of non-overlapping clips from each recording
in the following order: nine randomly selected 5-minute clips, five
1-minute clips manually selected as the top \enquote{turn-taking}
minutes of the recording, five 1-minute clips manually selected as the
top \enquote{vocal activity} minutes of the recording, and one, manually
selected 5-minute extension of the best 1-minute sample (see
\protect\hyperlink{fig2}{Figure 2}). We created these different
subsamples of each day to measure properties of (a) children's
\emph{average} language environments (random samples) and (b) their
\emph{most input-dense} language environments (turn-taking samples). The
third sample (high-activity) gave us insight into children's productive
speech abilities, but is discussed elsewhere (Casillas, in progress).

annotators (the first author and a student assistant) who listened to
each recording in its entirety at 1--2x speed while actively taking
notes about potentially useful clips. Afterwards, the first author
reviewed the list of candidate clips, listened again to each one (at 1x
speed with multiple repetitions), and chose the best five 1-minute
samples for each of the two types of activity. Good turn-taking activity
was defined as closely timed sequences of contingent vocalization
between the target child and at least one other person (i.e., frequent
vocalization exchanges). The \enquote{best} turn-taking clips were
chosen because they had the most and most clear turn-switching activity
between the target child and the other speaker(s). Good vocal activity
clips were defined as clips in which the target child produced the most
and most diverse spontaneous (i.e., not imitative) vocalizations. The
\enquote{best} vocal activity clips were chosen for representing the
most linguistically mature and/or diverse vocalizations made by the
child over the day. All else being equal, candidate clips were
prioritized when they contained less background noise or featured
speakers and speech that were not otherwise frequently represented
(e.g., CDS from older males). The best turn-taking clips and vocal
activity clips often overlapped; turn-taking clips were selected from
the list of candidates first, and then vocal-activity clips were chosen
from the remainder. Again, these manually selected clips were chosen
from audio that did not overlap with the initial \enquote{random} clip
selection. Therefore the true peak turn-taking and vocal-activity clips
for the day could possibly occur during the random clips---the manually
selected samples are the best examples from the remaining 8--10 hours of
audio. The instructions for manually selecting clips and the notes from
our Tseltal clip selection can be found at
\url{https://github.com/marisacasillas/Tseltal-CLE/blob/master/audio_scanning_instructions.md}.

The first author and a native speaker of Tseltal jointly transcribed and
annotated each clip in ELAN (Wittenburg, Brugman, Russel, Klassmann, \&
Sloetjes, 2006) using the ACLEW Annotation Scheme (Casillas et al.,
2017). The native Tseltal speaker lives in the community and knows most
of the recorded families personally. The annotations include the
transcription of (nearly) all hearable utterances in Tseltal, a loose
translation of each utterance into Spanish, vocal maturity measures of
each target child utterance (non-linguistic vocalizations/non-canonical
babbling/non-word canonical babbling/single words/multiple words), and
addressee annotations for all non-target-child utterances
(target-child-directed/other-child-directed/adult-directed/adult-and-child-directed/animal-directed/other-speaker-type-directed).
We annotated each utterance for intended addressee using contextual
interactional information from the photos, audio, and
preceding/following footage; we used an \enquote{unsure} category for
utterances with no clear classification.\footnote{Full documentation,
  including training materials, for the ACLEW Annotation Scheme can be
  found at \url{https://osf.io/b2jep/wiki/home/}.} We exported each ELAN
file as tab-separated values for all analysis.

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{methods-analysisinfo}

Our aim in this paper is to describe the quantitative characteristics of
Tseltal children's speech environments, as captured by the nine randomly
selected five-minute clips from each child. We analyze five measures of
children's speech environment: rate of target-child-directed speech
(TCDS min/hr) and rate of other-directed speech (ODS min/hr), the rate
of target-child-to-other turn transitions (TC--O transitions/min) and
other-to-target-child turn transitions (O--TC transitions/min), and the
duration of the target child's interactional sequences in seconds. For
each of these five measures we investigate the effects of child age,
time of day, household size, and number of speakers present. We then
briefly report on a comparative analysis modelind the same effects on
these five measures in the high turn-taking clips. We wrap up with two
descriptive analyses: an initial estimate of the amount of time Tseltal
children spend in high turn-taking interaction over the course of an
entire day and an outline of the trajectory for early vocal maturity.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}

Unless otherwise stated, all analyses were conducted with generalized
linear mixed-effects regressions using the glmmTMB package and all plots
are generate with ggplot2 in R (M. E. Brooks et al., 2017a; R Core Team,
2018; Wickham, 2009).\footnote{The data and analysis code are freely
  available on the web ({[}retracted for review{]}), as is a summary of
  the results which will be updated as more transcriptions become
  available ({[}retracted for review{]}).} Notably, all five speech
environment measures are restricted to non-negative values (min/hr, turn
transitions/min, and duration in seconds), with a subset of them also
displaying extra cases of zero in the randomly sampled clips (min/hr,
turn transitions/min; e.g., when the child is napping). The consequence
of these boundary restrictions is that the variance of the distributions
becomes non-gaussian (i.e., a long right tail). We account for this
issue by using negative binomial regression, whish is useful for
overdispersed count data (M. E. Brooks et al., 2017b; Smithson \&
Merkle, 2013). When extra cases of zero are present due to, e.g., no
speakers being present, we used a zero-inflation negative binomial
regression, which creates two models: (a) a binary model to evaluate the
likelihood of none vs.~some presence of the variable (e.g., TCDS) and
(b) a count model of the variable (e.g., \enquote{3} vs. \enquote{5}
TCDS min/hr), using the negative binomial distribution as the linking
function. Alternative analyses using gaussian models with logged
dependent variables are available in the Supplementary Materials, but
are qualitatively similar to the results we report here.

Our primary predictors were as follows: child age (months), household
size (number of people), and number of non-target-child speakers present
in that clip, all centered and standardized, plus squared time of day at
the start of the clip (in decimal hours; centered on noon and
standardized). We always used squared time of day to model the cycle of
activity at home: the mornings and evenings should be more similar to
each other than midday because people tend to disperse for chores after
breakfast. To this we also added two-way interactions between child age
and number of speakers present, household size, and time of day.
Finally, we included a random effect of child, with random slopes of
time of day, unless doing so resulted in model non-convergence. Finally,
for the zero-inflation models, we included child age, number of speakers
present, and time of day. We have noted below when models needed to
deviate from this core design to achieve convergence. We only report
significant effects here; full model outputs are available in the
Supplementary Materials.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Target-child-directed speech
(TCDS)}\label{target-child-directed-speech-tcds}

The Tseltal children in our study were directly spoken to for an average
of 3.63 minutes per hour in the random sample (median = 4.08; range =
0.83--6.55; \protect\hyperlink{fig3}{Figure 3}). These estimates are
close to those reported for Yucatec Mayan data (Shneidman \&
Goldin-Meadow, 2012), which are plotted with our data, along with
estimates from a few other populations in
\protect\hyperlink{fig4}{Figure 4} (US/Canada: Bergelson et al., 2018b;
Tsimane: Scaff et al., in preparation, see Scaff and colleagues Scaff et
al. (in preparation) for a more detailed comparison; US urban and
Yukatek: Shneidman, 2010; Mozambique urban and rural, and Dutch: Vogt et
al., 2015).\footnote{We convert the original estimates from Shneidman
  (2010) into min/hr by using the median utterance duration in our
  dataset for all non-target child speakers: (1029ms). Note that, though
  this conversion is far from perfect, Yukatek and Tseltal are related
  languages.}. We modeled TCDS min/hr in the random clips with a
zero-inflated negative binomial regression, as described above.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig4-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig4}TCDS rate reported from daylong recordings made in
different populations, including both urban (gray) and rural/indigenous
(black) samples. Each point is the average TCDS rate reported for
children at the indicated age, and size indicates number of children
sampled (range: 1--26). See text for references to original studies.}
\end{figure}

The rate of TCDS in the randomly sampled clips was primarily affected by
factors relating to the time of day. The count model showed that,
overall, children were more likely to hear TCDS in the mornings and
evenings than around midday (B = 4.32, SD = 1.92, z = 2.25, p = 0.02).
However, this pattern weakened for older children, some of whom even
heard peak TCDS input around midday, as illustrated in
\protect\hyperlink{fig5}{Figure 5} (B = -5.22, SD = 1.97, z = -2.64, p =
0.01). There were no significant effects of child age, household size,
or number of speakers present, no significant effects in the
zero-inflation model.\footnote{This TCDS zero-inflation did not include
  the number of speakers present or time of day.}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig5-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig5}TCDS rate heard at different times of day by
children 12 months and younger (left) and 13 months and older (right) in
the randomly selected (purple) and turn-taking (green) clips.}
\end{figure}

In contrast to findings from Shneidman and Goldin-Meadow (2012) on
Yucatec Mayan, most TCDS in the current data came from adult speakers
(mean = 80.61\%, median = 87.22\%, range = 45.90\%--100), with no
evidence for an increase in proportion TCDS from children with target
child age (correlation between child age and proportion TCDS from
children: Spearman's \emph{rho} = -0.29; \emph{p} = 0.42).

\subsection{Other-directed speech
(ODS)}\label{other-directed-speech-ods}

Children heard an average of 21.05 minutes per hour in the random sample
(median = 17.80; range = 3.57--42.80): that is, 5--6 times as much
speech as was directed to them. We modeled ODS min/hr in the random
clips with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression, as described
above.

The count model of ODS in the randomly selected clips revealed that the
presence of more speakers was strongly associated with more ODS (B =
1.06, SD = 0.09, z = 11.54, p = 0). Additionally, more ODS occurred in
the mornings and evenings (B = 2.70, SD = 1.14, z = 2.36, p = 0.02), and
was also more frequent in large households for older children compared
to younger children (B = 0.33, SD = 0.16, z = 2.01, p = 0.04). There
were no other significant effects on ODS rate, and no significant
effects in the zero-inflation models.\footnote{This ODS count model did
  not include by-child intercepts of time of day and its zero-inflation
  did not include the number of speakers present.}

Other-directed speech may have been so common because there were an
average 3.44 speakers present other than the target child in the
randomly selected clips (median = 3; range = 0--10), and (typically)
more than half of the speakers were adults. However, these estimates may
be comparable to North American infants (6--7 months) living in nuclear
family homes (Bergelson et al., 2018a), so a high incidence of ODS may
be common for infants in many sociocultural contexts.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Target-child-to-other turn transitions
(TC--O)}\label{target-child-to-other-turn-transitions-tco}

We detect contingent turn exchanges between the target child and other
speakers based on turn timing \protect\hyperlink{fig6}{Figure 6}. If a
child's vocalization is followed by a target-child-directed utterance
within -1000--2000msec of the end of the child's vocalization (Casillas,
Bobb, \& Clark, 2016; Hilbrink, Gattis, \& Levinson, 2015), it is
counted as a contingent response (i.e., a TC--O transition). We use the
same idea to find other-to-target-child transitions below (i.e., a
target-child-directed utterance followed by a target child vocalization
with the same overlap/gap restrictions). Each target child vocalization
can only have one prompt and one response and each target-child-directed
utterance can maximally count once as a prompt and once as a response
(e.g., in a TC--O--TC sequence, the \enquote{O} is both a response and a
prompt).

Gap and overlap restrictions are based on prior studies of infant and
young children's turn taking (Casillas et al., 2016; Hilbrink et al.,
2015), though the timing margins are increased slightly for the current
dataset because the prior estimates come from relatively short, intense
bouts of interaction in WEIRD parental contexts. Note, too, that much
prior work has used maximum gaps of similar or greater length to detect
verbal contingencies in caregiver-child interaction; and any work based
on LENA\textsuperscript{®} conversational blocks is thereby based on a
5-second silence maximum (Bergelson et al., 2018b; M. H. Bornstein,
Putnick, Cote, Haynes, \& Suwalsky, 2015; Broesch, Rochat, Olah,
Broesch, \& Henrich, 2016; Egeren, Barratt, \& Roach, 2001; Y. Kuchirko,
Tafuro, \& Tamis-LeMonda, 2018; Romeo et al., 2018; Warlaumont,
Richards, Gilkerson, \& Oller, 2016); in comparison our timing
restrictions are quite stringent.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig7-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig7}By-child estimates of contingent responses per
minute to the target child's vocalizations (left), contingent responses
per minute by the target child to others' target-child-directed speech
(middle), and the average duration of contingent interactional sequences
(right). Each datapoint represents the value for a single clip within
the random (purple; solid) or turn taking (green; dashed) samples. Bands
on the solid linear trends show 95\% CIs.}
\end{figure}

Other speakers responded contingently to the target children's
vocalizations at an average rate of 1.38 transitions per minute (median
= 0.40; range = 0--8.60). We modeled TC--O transtions per minute in the
random clips with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression, as
described above.

The rate at which children hear contingent response from others was
primarily influenced by factors relating to the child's age. Older
children heard more contingent responses then younger children when
there were more speakers present (B = 0.47, SD = 0.22, z = 2.11, p =
0.03). Also, as with the speech quantity measures, younger children
heard more contingent responses in the mornings and evenings while this
effect was less pronounced for older children (B = -6.46, SD = 2.56, z =
-2.52, p = 0.01).There were no other significant effects on TC--O
transition rate, and no significant effects in the zero-inflation model
either.\footnote{This TC--O transition count model did not include
  by-child intercepts of time of day.}

\subsection{Other-to-target-child turn transitions
(O--TC)}\label{other-to-target-child-turn-transitions-otc}

Tseltal children responded contingently to others' target-child
vocalizations at an average rate of 1.17 transitions per minute (median
= 0.20; range = 0--8.80). We modeled O--TC transtions per minute in the
random clips with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression, as
described above.

The rate at which children respond contingently to others (O--TC turn
transitions per minute) was similarly influenced by child age and time
of day: older children were less likely than young children to show peak
response rates in the morning and evening (B = -7.30, SD = 2.61, z =
-2.80, p = 0.01). There were no further significant effects in the count
or zero-inflation models.\footnote{This O--TC transition count model did
  not include by-child intercepts of time of day.}

\subsection{Sequence duration}\label{sequence-duration}

Sequences of interaction include periods of contingent turn taking with
at least one target child vocalization and one target-child-directed
prompt or response from another speaker. We use the same mechanism as
before to detect contingent TC--O and O--TC transitions, but also allow
for speakers to continue with multiple vocalizations in a row (e.g.,
TC--O--O--TC--OTH; \protect\hyperlink{fig7}{Figure 7}. Sequences are
bounded by the earliest and latest vocalization for which there is no
contingent prompt/response, respectively. Each target child vocalization
can only appear in one sequence, and many sequences have more than one
child vocalization. Because sequence durations were not zero-inflated,
we modeled them in the random clips with negative binomial regression.

We detected 311 interactional sequences in the 90 randomly selected
clips, with an average sequence duration of 10.13 seconds (median = 7;
range = 0.56--85.47). The average number of child vocalizations within
these sequences was 3.75 (range = 1--29; median = 3). None of the
predictors significantly impacted sequence duration (all \emph{p}
\textgreater{} 0.09).\footnote{This sequence duration model did not
  include by-child intercepts of time of day.}

\subsection{Peak interaction}\label{peak-interaction}

As expected, the turn-taking clips featured a much higher rate of
contingent turn transitions: the average TC--O transition rate was 7.73
transitions per minute (median = 7.80; range = 0--25) and the average
O--TC rate was 7.56 transitions per minute (median = 6.20; range =
0--26). The interactional sequences were also longer on average: 12.27
seconds (median = 8.10; range = 0.55--61.22).

Crucially, children also heard much more TCDS in the turn-taking
clips---13.28 min/hr (median = 13.65; range = 7.32--20.19)---while also
hearing less ODS---11.93 min/hr (median = 10.18; range = 1.37--24.42).

We modeled each of these five speech environment measures with parallel
models to those used above (with no zero-inflation model for TCDS,
TC--O, and O--TC rates, given the nature of the sample). The impact of
child age, time of day, household size, and number of speakers was
qualitatively similar (basic sample comparisons are visualized in
\protect\hyperlink{fig3}{Figure 3}, \protect\hyperlink{fig4}{Figure 4},
and \protect\hyperlink{fig6}{Figure 6}) between the randomly selected
clips and these peak periods of interaction with the following
exceptions: older children heard significantly less ODS (B = -0.47, SD =
0.20, z = -2.39, p = 0.02), the presence of more speakers significantly
decreased children's response rate to other's vocalizations (B = -0.26,
SD = 0.12, z = -2.19, p = 0.03), and children's interactional sequences
were shorter for older children (B = -0.24, SD = 0.10, z = -2.42, p =
0.02), shorter for children in large households (B = -0.21, SD = 0.10, z
= -2.25, p = 0.02), and longer during peak periods in the mornings and
afternoons (B = 2.76, SD = 1.11, z = 2.50, p = 0.01). Full model outputs
can be compared in the Supplementary Materials.

\subsubsection{Peak minutes in the day}\label{peak-minutes-in-the-day}

Now knowing the interactional characteristics of the \enquote{high}
turn-taking clips, we looked for similarly interactive 1-minute sections
in the random samples in order to estimate the number of high
interactivity minutes in the whole day. To do this, we scanned each
60-second window (e.g., 0--60 sec, 1--61 sec, etc.\footnote{60 seconds
  is the smallest clip sample size in the turn-taking segments}) of each
random clip from each child and recorded the observed turn-transition
rate. Only 6 of the 10 children showed at least one minute of their
random sample that equalled or exceeded the grand average
turn-transition rate (12.89 transitions per minute), and 7 of the 10
children showed at least one minute equalling or exceeding their own
average turn transition rate from their turn-taking samples, as shown in
\protect\hyperlink{fig8}{Figure 8}. Across children who did show
turn-taking \enquote{peaks} in their random data (i.e., at or above
rates from the sample-average from the turn-taking segments), periods of
\enquote{peak} interaction were relatively long, ranging in duration
from an average of 0 to 103 seconds across the 6 children with such
peaks.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig8-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig8}Turn-transitions rates, estimated over the last 60
seconds for each second of the random samples by child (nine 5-min clips
each). The horizontal line indicates the group mean turn-transition rate
in the turn-taking sample. The large points indicate the by-child mean
turn-transition rate in the turn-taking sample.}
\end{figure}

Assuming approximately 12 waking hours, we therefore very roughly
estimate that these Tseltal children spent an average of 100.16 minutes
(1.67 hours) in high turn-taking, dyadic interaction during their
recording day. However, the range in the quantity of high turn-taking
interaction varies enormously across children, starting at just a few
minutes per day and topping out at more than 419.73 minutes (7 hours) in
our sample.

\subsection{Vocal maturity}\label{vocal-maturity}

Children's vocalizations appear to follow the normative benchmarks for
productive speech development, as typically characterized by the
\emph{onset} of new production features. Decades of research in WEIRD
populations has shown that, typically, children begin producing
non-canonical babbles around 0;2, with canonical babbling appearing
around 0;7, first words around 1;0 (P. K. Kuhl, 2004; Oller, 1980;
Warlaumont \& Finnegan, 2016; Warlaumont et al., 2016), and first
multi-word utterances just after 1;6 (Braine \& Bowerman, 1976; Fine \&
Lieven, 1993; Frank et al., in preparation; Slobin, 1970; Tomasello \&
Brooks, 1999). These benchmarks are mirrored in the Tseltal data (see
\protect\hyperlink{fig9}{Figure 9}), which includes all annotated
vocalizations from the random, turn-taking, and high vocal activity
samples (N = 4725): there is a decline in the use of non-canonical
babble and an accompanying increase in the use of canonical babble from
0;6 to 1;0. Recognizable words are also observed for every child from
age 11;0 and older. Multi-word utterances already appear with the child
at 1;2 and make up \textasciitilde{}10--15\% of children's utterances
through the child at 2;3. The oldest two children use multi-word
utterances in 33\% and 45\% of their vocalizations respectively.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig9-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig9}Proportion of vocalization types used by children
across age (NCB = Non-canonical babble, CB = Canonical babble, SW =
single word utterance, MW = multi-word utterance).}
\end{figure}

These data are also consistent with usage statistics of speech-like
vocalizations by WEIRD infants (Oller, 1980; Warlaumont \& Finnegan,
2016; Warlaumont et al., 2016). In their Warlaumont et al. (2016) study,
Warlaumont and colleagues found that the proportion of speech-like
vocalizations (speech, non-word babble, and singing) was
\textasciitilde{}0.6 around age one in their SES-variable dataset of 106
children. We estimated the number of speech-like (canonical babbling and
lexical speech) and non-speech-like (cries, laughter, and non-canonical
babbles) vocalizations from Tseltal children 14 months and
younger\footnote{We cannot compare speech-like vs.~non-speech-like
  vocalizations after 1;6 due to a limitation of the ACLEW Annotation
  Scheme (Casillas et al., 2017).} across the random, turn-taking, and
high vocal activity samples (N = 3020 from 6 children). Between 2 and 14
months, Tseltal children demonstrated a large increase in the proportion
of speech-like vocalizations (canonical babbling and lexical speech):
from 9\% before 0;6 to 58\% between 0;10 and 1;2. Around age 1;0, their
use of speech-like vocalizations (58\%) is nearly identical to that
estimated by Warlaumont et al. (2016) for American children
(\textasciitilde{}60\%).

\section{Discussion}\label{disc}

We analyzed 10 Tseltal Mayan children's speech environments in order to
estimate how often they have the opportunity to attend and respond to
speech directed to them. We also investigated how these speech
environment characteristics changed (or stayed stable) across different
ages, household sizes, time of day, and number of speakers present. To
achieve representative estimates, we sampled audio segments randomly
from each child's daylong recording, but we show that most of the same
general patterns hold up during the \enquote{peak} turn-taking moments
of the day as well. Finally, we roughly estimated the number of
\enquote{high interactivity} minutes Tseltal children encounter on a
typical day and demonstrated that, despite the relatively small quantity
of CDS, children's early vocal development was on-par with norms built
from WEIRD children's data. These findings, which use a new methodology
(i.e., daylong recordings with multiple sample types), partly replicate
estimates of child language input and development in previous
ethnographic and psycholinguistic work on Yucatec and Tseltal Mayan
communities (P. Brown, 1997, 1998c, 2011, Tseltal: 2014; Shneidman,
2010; Yucatec: Shneidman et al., 2012). In what follows we briefly
review each of the predictions made at the outset of the paper.

\subsection{How much directed speech do Tseltal children
hear?}\label{how-much-directed-speech-do-tseltal-children-hear}

The bulk of our analyses were aimed at understanding how much speech
Tseltal children hear: we wanted to know how often they are directly
spoken to and how often they might be able to listen to other-directed
speech around them. As suggested by prior work, the children were only
infrequently directly spoken to: an average of 3.63 minutes per hour in
the random sample. Compared to other studies based on daylong
recordings, the Tseltal average TCDS rate is approximately a third of
that found for North American children (Bergelson et al., 2018b), but is
comparable to that for Tsimane children (Scaff et al., in preparation).
The CDS estimates also fall almost precisely in-line with those based on
short-format recordings in a Yucatec Mayan village (Shneidman, 2010;
Shneidman et al., 2012).

A novel contribution of this study is that we also included interactive
measures to describe how often children were directly engaged with an
interlocutor, either as a responder or as an addressee being responded
to. We found that children's vocalizations were responded to at a rate
of 1.38 speaker transitions per minute and that children responded to
others' child-directed vocalizations at a rate of 1.17 transitions per
minute. Prior work from a number of different domains suggests that
contingent interaction (and the joint attention that likely accompanies
it) is an ideal context for language learning since the child and
interlocutor's coordinated attentional states decrease referential
uncertainty, are a source of dynamic feedback, and can spur more
interactions in the near future (M. H. Bornstein et al., 2015; Broesch
et al., 2016; Egeren et al., 2001; Y. Kuchirko et al., 2018; Romeo et
al., 2018; Warlaumont \& Finnegan, 2016; Warlaumont et al., 2016).
Because our measure is a novel one, we cannot directly compare Tseltal
children's data with those of children growing up in other communities.
That said, 1.38 and 1.17 transitions per minute suggests that contingent
responses---more so than speech directly addressed to the child---are
rare across children's day. Importantly, however, this may be due to the
fact that children did not vocalize very often.

Preliminary analyses of children's vocal maturity showed that, on
average, children only produced 472.50 vocalizations (many of which were
crying, laughter, and non-canonical babble) during the entire 1-hour of
clips sampled from their daylong recordings. This explanation resonates
with the fact that, despite the low frequency of contingent turn-taking
in the random sample, interactional sequences were fairly long: 10.13
seconds. During these long sequences, children tended to only vocalize
3.75 times, meaning that many of children's dyadic interactional
sequences are marked by longer streams of directed input from another
speaker, interspersed with only occasional responses from the child.
Interactional peaks with contingent turn-taking \emph{do} occur in the
data, only rarely; our rough estimate is that Tseltal children
participate in approximately 100.16 minutes of such interaction during a
12-hour waking day, most of which come in bursts of \textasciitilde{}53
seconds long.

In sum, our results confirm prior claims that Tseltal children, like
other Mayan children, are not often directly spoken to. When they are,
much of their speech comes in interactional sequences in which children
only play a minor part---directly contingent turn transitions between
children and their interlocutors are relatively rare. However, we
estimate that the average child under age 3;0 experiences more than one
cumulative hour of high-intensity contingent interaction with CDS per
day. If child-directed speech quantity linearly feeds language
development (such that more input begets more output), then the
estimates presented here would lead us to expect that Tseltal children
are delayed in their language development, at least relative to North
American children. However, our initial analyses of early vocal
development suggest that Tseltal children, though they may not vocalize
often, demonstrate vocal maturity comparable to children from societies
in which CDS is known to be more frequent (Braine \& Bowerman, 1976;
Fine \& Lieven, 1993; Frank et al., in preparation; P. K. Kuhl, 2004;
Oller, 1980; Tomasello \& Brooks, 1999; Warlaumont \& Finnegan, 2016;
Warlaumont et al., 2016). How do Tseltal children manage this feat?

\subsubsection{Other-directed speech}\label{other-directed-speech}

One proposal is that Mayan children become experts at learning from
observation during their daily interactions (León, 2011; Rogoff et al.,
2003; Shneidman, 2010; Shneidman et al., 2012), thereby bridging the
\enquote{gap} otherwise left by the lower rate of CDS. In the randomly
selected clips, children were within hearing distance of other-directed
speech for an average of 21.05 minutes per hour. That is substantially
more than the \textasciitilde{}7 minute per hour heard by North American
children (Bergelson et al., 2018b), but comparable to the
\textasciitilde{}10 minutes per hour heard by Tsimane children (Scaff et
al., in preparation). The large quantity of other-directed speech is
likely due to the fact that Tseltal children (like Tsimane children)
tend to live in households with more people compared to North American
children (Bergelson et al., 2018a).

In our data, the presence of more speakers was associated with
significantly more other-directed speech, both based on the number of
individual voices present in the clip and on the number of people living
in the household (for younger children). In comparison, children also
heard more CDS when more speakers were present, but the effect was much
weaker (0.2440 vs.~1.05622 more minutes per hour per speaker unit). This
finding rings true with Brown's (2011, 2014) claim that Tseltal is a
non-child-centric language community; the presence of more people
somewhat increases talk to the child but really primarily increases talk
amongst the other speakers. However, given that this increase in the
number of speakers and amount of talk is also associated with an
increase in the amount of overlapping speech (G. Cristia Alejandrina,
2018), we suggest that attention to other-directed speech is at least
not the only learning mechanism needed to explain the robustness of
early vocal development in Tseltal. Furthermore, just because speech is
hearable does not mean children are attending to it. Follow-up work on
the role of other-directed speech in children's speech development would
need to clarify what constitutes viable \enquote{listened to} speech by
the child.

\subsubsection{Increased CDS with age}\label{increased-cds-with-age}

Another possibility is that CDS increases rapidly with child age (and
vocalization competence). Combined with the idea that very early
vocalizations follow a relatively species-specific, pre-programmed path
that is then modulated by caregiver response and other factors (Oller,
1980; Oller, Griebel, \& Warlaumont, 2016; Warlaumont \& Finnegan, 2016;
Warlaumont et al., 2016), a dramatic increase in directed speech with
age might be expected. In her longitudinal studies of Yucatec Mayan
children, Shneidman (2012) found that CDS increased significantly with
age, from 55 utterances in an hour to 209 between 13 and 35 months. Her
analyses show that most of the increase in CDS comes from other children
speaking to the target child. Her findings are consistent with other
reports that Mayan children are more often cared for by their older
siblings from later infancy onward (2011, 2014). In our data, however,
age effects were limited, and CDS from children was relatively rare
(\textasciitilde{}10\%) all the way up through age 3;0.

Child age alone had very little overall effect on the speech environment
measures. In the random sample it was, at most, associated with marginal
increases in TC--O transition rate, O--TC transition rate, and sequence
duration. All other significant effects involving age related to the
time of day measure, which is discussed below.

The non-increase in CDS with age may be due to the fact CDS from other
children was infrequent in our data (cf. Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow,
2012). The relative lack of CDS may be due to the fact that: (a) the
children were relatively young and so spent much of their time with
their mothers, (b) these particular children did not have many older
siblings, and (c) in the daylong recording context more adults were
present to talk to each other than would be typical in a short-format
recording (the basis for previous estimates). We conclude, from these
findings, that an increase in CDS cannot explain the robust pattern of
Tseltal vocal development either.

\subsubsection{Learning from short periods of
interaction}\label{learning-from-short-periods-of-interaction}

A third possibility is that these children learn effectively from short,
routine language encounters. Bursty input appears to be the norm across
a number of linguistic and interactive scales (Abney et al., 2018; Blasi
et al., in preparation; Fusaroli et al., 2014), and experiment-based
work suggests that children can benefit from massed presentation of new
information (Schwab \& Lew-Williams, 2016). We propose two mechanisms
through which Tseltal children might capitalize on the distribution of
speech input in their environment: they experience most language input
during routine activities and they can consolidate experienced input
during the downtime between interactive peaks. Neither of these
mechanisms are proposed to be particular to Tseltal children, but might
be employed to explain their efficient learning.

Tseltal children's linguistic input is not uniformly distributed over
the day: all five measures of children's linguistic environment were
more likely to occur in the mornings and afternoons than around midday,
though younger children showed this pattern more robustly than older
children. We had predicted a dip in linguistic input around midday
because household members tend to disperse after breakfast to do their
daily work before returning for another late afternoon meal. Young
children, who are typically carried by their mothers for the majority of
the day, followed this pattern more strongly than older children, who
may have been more free to seek out interactions between mealtimes. A
similar midday dip has been previously found for North American
children's daylong recordings (Greenwood et al., 2011; Soderstrom \&
Wittebolle, 2013), suggesting that non-uniform distributions of
linguistic input may be the norm for children in a variety of different
cultural-economic contexts. Our paper is the first to show that those
time of day effects change with age in the first few years on a number
of speech environment features (TCDS, TC--O transitions, O--TC
transitions, and (marginally) ODS).

Our impression from having transcribed these data is that the time of
day effects likely arise from the activities that typically occur in the
mornings and afternoons---meal preparation and dining times in
particular---while napping could contribute to the midday dip
(Soderstrom \& Wittebolle, 2013). Indeed, time of day effects in daylong
recordings at Canadian homes and daycares were substantially weakened
when naptimes were excluded from the analysis (Soderstrom \& Wittebolle,
2013). However, in the same Canadian data, the highest density speech
input came during storytime and organized playtime (e.g., sing-alongs,
painting), while mealtime was associated with less speech input. We
expect that follow-up research which tracks activities in the Tseltal
data will lead to very different conclusions: storytime and organized
playtime are vanishingly rare in this non-child-centric community, and
mealtime may represent a time of routine and rich linguistic experience.
In both cases, however, the underlying association with activity (not
hour) implies the possibility for action routines that may help children
optimally extract information about what they will encounter and what
they are expected to do in response, even over short periods (Bruner,
1983; Ferrier, 1978; tamis2018routine; Nelson, 1985; Shatz, 1978; Snow
\& Goldfield, 1983).

A more speculative possibility is that Tseltal children learn language
on a natural input-consolidation cycle: the rarity of interactional
peaks throughout the day may be complemented by an opportunity to
consolidate new information. Sleep has been shown to benefit language
learning tasks in both adults (Dumay \& Gaskell, 2007; Frost \&
Monaghan, 2017; Mirković \& Gaskell, 2016) and children (Gómez, Bootzin,
\& Nadel, 2006; Horváth, Liu, \& Plunkett, 2016; Hupbach, Gomez,
Bootzin, \& Nadel, 2009; Williams \& Horst, 2014), including word
learning, phonotactic constraints, and syntactic structure. Our
impression, both from the recordings and informal observations made
during visits to the community, is that young Tseltal children take
frequent naps, particularly at younger ages when they spend much of
their day wrapped within the shawl on their mother's back. Mayan
children tend to pick their own resting times (i.e., there are no
formalized ``sleep'' times, even at bedtime Morelli, Rogoff, Oppenheim,
\& Goldsmith, 1992), and Mayan mothers take special care to keep infants
in a calm and soothing environment in the first few months of life
(Brazelton, 1972; e.g., León, 2000; Pye, 1992; E. Z. Vogt, 1976). There
is little quantitative data on Mayan children's daytime and nighttime
sleeping patterns, but one study estimates that Yucatec Mayan children
between 0;0 and 2;0sleep or rest nearly 15\% of the time between morning
and evening (Gaskins, 2000), again, at times that suited the child (@
Morelli et al., 1992). If Tseltal children's interactional peaks are
bookended by short naps, it could contribute to efficient consolidation
of new information encountered. How often Tseltal children sleep, how
deeply, and how their sleeping patterns may relate to their linguistic
development is an important topic for future research.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}\label{disc-limfut}

The current findings are based on a cross-sectional analysis of only 10
children. From each child, we have manually only analyzed a total of 1
of the 9--11 recording hours. The findings only take into account verbal
input; the photo-linked audio we produce is not sufficient to analyze
gaze and gestural behavior (P. Brown, 2014). In short, more data, and
more kinds of data are needed to enrich this initial description of
Tseltal children's early language environments. We have also used vocal
maturity as an index of linguistic development in the current study, but
further analysis of these children's receptive and productive lexical,
morphological, and syntactic knowledge, including experiment and
questionnaire based measures that build on past linguistic work (P.
Brown, 1997, 1998b, 1998c, 1998a, 2011, 2014; P. Brown \& Gaskins, 2014)
is needed to establish trajectory of early language development in
Tseltal.\footnote{Other corpus- and experiment-based data and analyses
  from the Tseltal community are made available via the Casillas
  HomeBank corpus.} To fully understand the extent to which language
learning mechanisms are shared across ethnolinguistically diverse
samples we cannot simply continue to compare developmental benchmarks.
More promising long-term approaches include a focus on how
within-community differences and/or cross-linguistic differences for
related languages drive variation in learning (e.g., Pye, 2017;
Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013). The current analyses are based on a corpus
that is under active development. As new data are added, up-to-date
versions of the same analyses will be available on the same page where
the current data and analysis scripts can be found: URL.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{disc-conclusion}

Based on the current data, we estimate that Tseltal children hear an
average of 3.6 minutes of directed speech per hour. Contingent
turn-taking is relatively rare throughout their day, and high-intensity
interactive input comes in short bursts, typically in the mornings and
early evenings for younger children. Despite this relatively small
quantity of directed speech, Tseltal children's vocal maturity looks
on-track with estimates based on WEIRD populations, in which children
typically experience more child-directed speech. Our findings by and
large replicate the descriptions put forth by linguistic anthropologists
who have worked with Mayan communities for many decades. The real puzzle
is then how Tseltal children efficiently extract information from their
linguistic environments. We reviewed several proposals and outlined
directions for future work. In our view, a promising avenue for
continued research is to more closely investigate the
activity/time-of-day effects and a possible input-consolidation cycle
for language exposure in early infancy. By better understanding how
Tseltal children learn language, we hope to uncover some of the ways in
which human learning mechanisms are adaptive to the thousands of
ethnolinguistic environments in which children develop.
