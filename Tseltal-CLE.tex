\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

A great deal of work in developmental language science revolves around
one central question: What linguistic evidence (i.e., what types and how
much) is needed to support first language acquisition? In pursuing this
topic, many researchers have fixed their sights on the quantity and
characteristics of speech addressed to children; that is, speech
designed for young recipients who may have limited attention and
understanding (e.g., Golinkoff, Can, Soderstrom, \& Hirsh-Pasek, 2015;
Hoff, 2006). In several languages, child-directed speech (CDS\footnote{Throughout
  this article, we use \enquote{child-directed speech} and \enquote{CDS}
  in the most literal sense: speech designed for and directed toward a
  child recipient.}) is linguistically accommodated to young listeners
(Cristia, 2013; Soderstrom, 2007), interactionally rich (Bruner, 1985;
Butterworth, 2003; Estigarribia \& Clark, 2007; Masataka, 2003), and
preferred by infants (Cooper \& Aslin, 1990; ManyBabies Collaborative,
2017; Segal \& Newman, 2015). In those same linguistic communities,
these properties of CDS have been found to facilitate early word
learning (Cartmill et al., 2013; e.g., Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2015; Hoff,
2003; Hurtado, Marchman, \& Fernald, 2008; Rowe, 2008; Shneidman \&
Goldin-Meadow, 2012; Shneidman, Arroyo, Levine, \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012;
Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013). Yet ethnographic reports from a number of
traditional, non-Western communities suggest that children easily
acquire their community's language(s) even when the children are
infrequently directly addressed (P. Brown, 2011). If so, large
quantities of CDS may not be essential for learning language; just
useful for facilitating certain aspects of language development. In this
paper we investigate the language environment and early development of
10 Tseltal Mayan children growing up in a community where caregivers are
reported to infrequently directly address speech to infants and young
children (P. Brown, 1998, 2011, 2014).

\subsection{Child-directed speech}\label{intro-cds}

Prior work on CDS in Western contexts has shown that the amount of CDS
children hear influences their language development; more CDS is
associated with larger and faster-growing receptive and productive
vocabularies in young children (e.g., Hart \& Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003;
Hurtado et al., 2008; Peter, Durrant, Bidgood, Pine, \& Rowland, in
preparation; Ramírez-Esparza, García-Sierra, \& Kuhl, 2014, 2017;
Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012; Shneidman et al., 2012; Weisleder \&
Fernald, 2013). CDS has also been linked to young children's speed of
lexical retrieval (Hurtado et al., 2008; but see Peter et al., in
preparation; Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013) and syntactic development
(Huttenlocher, Waterfall, Vasilyeva, Vevea, \& Hedges, 2010). The
conclusion drawn from much of this work is that speech directed to
children is well designed for learning words---especially concrete nouns
and verbs---because it is optimized for a child's attention in the
moment it is spoken. Even outside of first-person interaction, infants
and young children prefer listening to attention-grabbing CDS over
adult-directed speech (ManyBabies Collaborative, 2017). There are,
however, a few significant caveats to the body of work relating CDS
quantity to language development.

First, while there is overwhelming evidence linking CDS quantity to
vocabulary size, links to grammatical development are more scant (e.g.,
Brinchmann, Braeken, \& Lyster, 2019; Frank, Braginsky, Marchman, \&
Yurovsky, in preparation; Huttenlocher et al., 2010). While the
advantage of CDS for referential word learning is clear, it is less
obvious how CDS facilitates syntactic learning. For example, utterance
length (a proxy for syntactic complexity; Wasow, 1997) doesn't appear to
increase with child age (Newport, Gleitman, \& Gleitman, 1977), and
parents may be less likely to directly correct their children's
syntactic errors than their semantic ones (R. Brown, 1977; but see
Chouinard \& Clark, 2003)---even sometimes themselves producing
ungrammatical utterances to make individual words salient to their young
interlocutors (Aslin, Woodward, LaMendola, \& Bever, 1996; see also
Yurovsky, 2018). On the other hand, there is a wealth of evidence that
syntactic knowledge is lexically specified (e.g., Arnold, Wasow, Asudeh,
\& Alrenga, 2004; Goldberg, 2003; Lieven, Pine, \& Baldwin, 1997), and
that, crosslinguistically, children's vocabulary size is one of the most
robust predictors of their early syntactic development (Bates \&
Goodman, 1997; Frank et al., in preparation; Marchman,
Martínez-Sussmann, \& Dale, 2004). In short, what is good for the
lexicon may also be good for syntax. For now, however, the link between
CDS and other aspects of grammatical development still needs to be more
thoroughly tested.

A second caveat is that most work on CDS quantity uses summary measures
that average over the ebb and flow of interaction (e.g., proportion
CDS). In both child and adult interactions, verbal behaviors are highly
structured: while some occur at fairly regular intervals
(\enquote{periodic} ), others occur in shorter, more intense bouts
separated by long periods of inactivity (``bursty'' ; Abney, Dale,
Louwerse, \& Kello, 2018; Fusaroli, Razczaszek-Leonardi, \& Tylén,
2014). For example, Abney and colleagues (2017) found that, across
multiple time scales of daylong recordings, both infants' and adults'
vocal behavior was clustered. Focusing on lexical development, Blasi and
colleagues (in preparation) also found that nouns and verbs were used
burstily in child-proximal speech across all six of the languages in
their typologically diverse sample. Infrequent words were somewhat more
bursty overall, leading them to propose that burstiness may play a key
and universal role in acquiring otherwise-rare linguistic units.
Experiment-based work also shows that two-year-olds learn novel words
better from a massed presentation of object labels versus a distributed
presentation (but see Ambridge, Theakston, Lieven, \& Tomasello, 2006,
and @childers2002two; Schwab \& Lew-Williams, 2016). Structured temporal
characteristics in children's language experience imply new roles for
attention and memory in language development. Ideally, then, we should
be investigating how CDS is distributed over children's daily
experiences (Soderstrom \& Wittebolle, 2013).

Finally, prior work has typically focused on Western (primarily North
American) populations, limiting our ability to generalize these effects
to children acquiring language worldwide (P. Brown \& Gaskins, 2014;
Henrich, Heine, \& Norenzayan, 2010; Lieven, 1994; M. Nielsen, Haun,
Kärtner, \& Legare, 2017). While we do gain valuable insight by looking
at \emph{within-population} variation (e.g., different socioeconomic or
sub-cultures), we can more effectively find places where our assumptions
break down by studying \emph{new} populations. Linguistic
anthropologists working in non-Western communities have long reported
that caregiver interaction styles vary immensely from place to place,
with some caregivers using little child-directed speech with young
children (P. Brown \& Gaskins, 2014; Gaskins, 2006; Lieven, 1994).
Children in these communities reportedly acquire language with
\enquote{typical}-looking benchmarks. For example, they start pointing
and talking around the same time we would expect for Western
middle-class infants (P. Brown, 2011, 2014; P. Brown \& Gaskins, 2014;
Liszkowski, Brown, Callaghan, Takada, \& De Vos, 2012; but see Salomo \&
Liszkowski, 2013). These findings have had little impact on mainstream
theories of word learning and language acquisition, partly due to a lack
of directly comparable measures (P. Brown, 2014; P. Brown \& Gaskins,
2014). If, however, children in these communities indeed acquire
language without delay, despite infrequent CDS, we must reconsider what
kind of linguistic evidence is necessary for children to learn language.

\subsection{Language development in non-WEIRD
communities}\label{intro-nonweird}

A growing number of researchers are using methods from developmental
psycholinguistics to describe the language environments and linguistic
development of children growing up in traditional and/or non-Western
communities (Barrett et al., 2013; Demuth, Moloi, \& Machobane, 2010;
Fortier, Kellier, Fernández Flecha, \& Frank, under review; see also
Ganek, Smyth, Nixon, \& Eriks-Brophy, 2018; Garcia, Roeser, \& Höhle,
2018; Hernik \& Broesch, 2018). We briefly highlight two recent efforts
along these lines, but see Cristia and colleagues' (2017) and Mastin and
Vogt's work (2016; 2015) for similar examples.

Scaff, Cristia, and colleagues (2017; in preparation) have used a number
of methods to estimate how much speech children hear in a Tsimane
forager-horticulturalist population in the Bolivian lowlands. From
daylong audio recordings, they estimate that Tsimane children between
0;6 and 6;0 hear maximally \textasciitilde{}5 minutes of directly
addressed speech per hour, regardless of their age. For comparison,
children from North American homes between ages 0;3 and 3;0 are
estimated to hear \textasciitilde{}11 minutes of CDS per hour in daylong
recordings (Bergelson et al., 2018b). Tsimane children also hear
\textasciitilde{}10 minutes of other-directed speech per hour (e.g.,
talk between adults) compared to the \textasciitilde{}7 minutes per hour
heard by young North American children (Bergelson et al., 2018b). This
difference may be attributable to the fact that the Tsimane live in
extended family clusters of 3--4 households, so speakers are typically
in close proximity to 5--8 other people (Cristia et al., 2017).

Shneidman and colleagues (2010; 2012) analyzed speech from one-hour
at-home video recordings of children between ages 1;0 and 3;0 in two
communities: Yucatec Mayan (Southern Mexico) and North American (a major
U.S. city). Their analyses yielded four main findings: compared to the
American children, (a) the Yucatec children heard many fewer utterances
per hour, (b) a much smaller proportion of the utterances they heard
were child-directed, (c) the proportion of utterances that were
child-directed increased dramatically with age, matching U.S. children's
by 3;0 months, and (d) most of the added CDS came from other children
(e.g., older siblings and cousins). They also demonstrated that the
lexical diversity of the CDS they hear at 24 months---particularly from
adult speakers---predicted children's vocabulary knowledge at 35 months.

These groundbreaking studies establish a number of important findings:
First, children in each of these communities appear able to acquire
their languages with relatively little CDS. Second, CDS might become
more frequent as children get older, though this could largely be due to
speech from other children. Finally, despite these differences, CDS from
adults may still be the most robust predictor of vocabulary growth.

\subsection{The current study}\label{intro-currentstudy}

We examine the early language experience of 10 Tseltal Mayan children
under age 3;0. Prior ethnographic work suggests that Tseltal caregivers
do not frequently speak directly to their children until the children
themselves begin to actively initiate verbal interactions (P. Brown,
2011, 2014). Nonetheless, Tseltal children develop language with no
apparent delays. Tseltal Mayan language and culture has much in common
with the Yucatec Mayan communities Shneidman reports on, allowing us to
compare differences in child language environments between the two sites
more directly than before.\footnote{For a review of comparative work on
  language socialization in Mayan cultures, see Pye (2017).} We provide
more details on this community and dataset in the
\protect\hyperlink{methods}{Methods section}.

We analyzed basic measures of Tseltal children's language environments
including: (a) the quantity of speech directed to them, (b) the quantity
of other-directed speech they could overhear from nearby speakers, (c)
the rate of contingent responses to their vocalizations, (d) the rate of
their own contingent responses to others' vocalizations, and (e) the
duration of their interactional dyadic sequences. To link these findings
to prior work on speech environment and development, we also rougly
estimated the number of minutes per day they spent in \enquote{high
turn-taking} interaction and outlined a basic trajectory for early vocal
development (i.e., from non-canonical babbles to multi-word utterances).

Based on prior work, we predicted that Tseltal Mayan children are
infrequently directly addressed, that the amount of CDS and contingent
responses they hear increases with age, that most CDS comes from other
children, and that, despite this, their early vocal development is on
par with Western children. We additionally predicted that children's
language environments would be bursty---that high-intensity interactions
would be brief and sparsely distributed throughout the day, accounting
for the majority of children's daily CDS.

\hypertarget{methods}{\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\subsection{Community}\label{methods-community}

The children in our dataset come from a small-scale, subsistence farming
community in the highlands of Chiapas in Southern Mexico. The vast
majority of children grow up speaking Tseltal monolingually at home. The
first few years of primary school are conducted mainly in Tseltal, but
the remainder of primary school, secondary school, and any further
education is conducted exclusively in Spanish. Nuclear families are
often large (5+ children) and live in patrilineal clusters. Nearly all
families grow staple crops such as corn and beans, but also cultivate
bananas, chilies, squash, coffee, and more. Household and farming work
is divided among men, women, and older children. Women do much of the
daily cleaning and food preparation, but also frequently work in the
garden, haul water and/or firewood, and do other physical labor. A few
community members---both men and women---earn incomes as teachers and
shopkeepers but are still expected to regularly contribute to their
family's household work.

More than forty years of ethnographic work by the second author has
supported the idea that Tseltal children's language environments are
non-child-centered and non-object-centered (P. Brown, 1998, 2011, 2014).
During their waking hours, Tseltal infants are typically tied to their
mother's back while she goes about her work for the day. Infants receive
very little direct speech until they themselves begin to initiate
interactions, usually as they approach their first birthdays. Even then,
interactional exchanges are often brief or non-verbal (e.g., object
exchange routines) and take place within a multi-participant context (P.
Brown, 2014). Rarely is attention given to words and their meanings,
even when objects are central to the activity. Instead, interactions
tend to focus on appropriate actions and responses, and young children
are socialized to attend to the interactions taking place around them
(see also León, 2011; Rogoff, Paradise, Arauz, Correa-Chávez, \&
Angelillo, 2003).

Young children are often cared for by other family members, especially
older siblings. Even when not on their mother's back, infants are rarely
put on the ground. Therefore, children can't usually pick up the objects
around them until they are old enough to walk. Toys are scarce and books
are vanishingly rare, so the objects children do get their hands on tend
to be natural or household objects (e.g., rocks, sticks, spoons,
baskets, etc.). By age five, most children are competent speakers who
engage daily in chores and the caregiving of their younger siblings. The
Tseltal approach to caregiving is similar to that described for other
Mayan communities (Gaskins, 1996, 1999; León, 1998, 2011; Pye, 1986;
Rogoff et al., 1993, 2003; e.g., Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012).

\subsection{Corpus}\label{methods-corpus}

The current data come from the Casillas HomeBank Corpus (Casillas,
Brown, \& Levinson, 2017; VanDam et al., 2016), which includes daylong
recordings and other developmental language data from more than 100
children under 4;0 across two indigenous, non-WEIRD communities: the
Tseltal Mayan community described here and a Papua New Guinean community
described elsewhere (P. Brown, 2011, 2014; P. Brown \& Casillas, in
press).

The Tseltal data, primarily collected in 2015, include recordings from
55 children born to 43 mothers. The families in our dataset typically
only had 2--3 children (median = 2; range = 1--9), due to the fact that
the participating families come from a young subsample of the community
(mothers: mean = 26.3 years; median = 25; range = 16--43 and fathers:
mean = 30; median = 27; range = 17---52). On average, mothers were 20
years old when they had their first child (median = 19; range = 12--27),
with a following inter-child interval of 3 years (median = 2.8; range =
1--8.5).\footnote{These estimates do not include miscarriages or
  children who passed away.}. As a result, 28\% of the participating
families had two children under 4;0. To our knowledge at time of
recording, all children were typically developing. We calculated the
precise age of children based on the birthdates given by their
caregivers, though these ages should be taken with a pinch of salt
because documentation of birthdates is less rigorous than would be
typically expected in Western post-industrial populations. Households
size, defined in our dataset by the number of people sharing a kitchen
or other primary living space, ranged between between 3 and 15 people
(mean = 7.2; median = 7). Although 32.7\% (18/55) of the target children
are first-born, they were rarely the only child in their household.
Caregiver education is one (imperfect) measure of contact with Western
culture. Most mothers had finished primary (37\%) or secondary (30\%)
school, with a few more having completed preparatory (12\%) or
university (2\%; 1 mother); the remainder (23\%) had no schooling or did
not complete primary school. All fathers had finished primary school,
with most completing secondary school (44\%) or preparatory school
(21\%), and two completing a university-level training (5\%). Clan
membership influences marriage and land inheritance such that 93\% of
the fathers grew up in the village where the recordings took place,
while only 53\% of the mothers did.

\subsubsection{Recordings}\label{methods-corpus-recs}

Methods for estimating the quantity of speech that children hear have
advanced significantly in the past two decades, with long-format at-home
audio recordings quickly becoming the new standard (e.g., with the
LENA\textsuperscript{®} system; Greenwood, Thiemann-Bourque, Walker,
Buzhardt, \& Gilkerson, 2011). These recordings capture a wider range of
the linguistic patterns children hear as they participate in different
activities with different speakers over the course of their day. In
long-format recordings, caregivers also tend to use less CDS (Bergelson,
Amatuni, Dailey, Koorathota, \& Tor, 2018a; Tamis-LeMonda, Kuchirko,
Luo, Escobar, \& Bornstein, 2017). The goal of these recordings is to
more or less capture a representative sample of what the child hears and
says at home.

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{The recording vest fit over children's chests with an audio recording device in the front horizontal pocket and a camera fitted with a fisheye lens attached to the a shoulder strap.}\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

We used a novel combination of a lightweight stereo audio recorder
(Olympus\textsuperscript{®} WS-832) and wearable photo camera (Narrative
Clip 1\textsuperscript{®}) fitted with a fish-eye lens, to track
children's movements and interactions over the course of a 9--11-hour
period in which the experimenter was not present. Each recording was
made during a single day at home in which the recorder and/or camera was
attached to the child. Ambulatory children wore both devices on an
elastic vest. Non-ambulatory children wore the recorder in a onesie
while their primary caregiver wore the camera on an elastic vest (see
\protect\hyperlink{fig1}{Figure 1}). The camera was set to take photos
at 30-second intervals and was synchronized to the audio in
post-processing to create a video file featuring the snapshot-linked
audio from the child's recording.\footnote{Documentation and scripts for
  post-processing are available at and
  \url{https://github.com/marisacasillas/Weave}.}

\subsection{Data selection and annotation}\label{methods-samples}

We annotated video clips from 10 of the 55 children's recordings. We
chose these 10 recordings to maximize variance in three demographic
variables: child age (0--3;0), child sex, and maternal education. The
sample is summarized in \emph{Table 1} \emph{{[}TASK: Make table{]}}. We
then selected one hour's worth of non-overlapping clips from each
recording in the following order: nine randomly selected 5-minute clips,
five 1-minute clips manually selected as the top \enquote{turn-taking}
minutes of the recording, five 1-minute clips manually selected as the
top \enquote{vocal activity} minutes of the recording, and one, manually
selected 5-minute extension of the best 1-minute sample (see
\protect\hyperlink{fig2}{Figure 2}). We created these different
subsamples of each day to measure properties of (a) children's
\emph{average} language environments (random samples) and (b) their
\emph{most input-dense} language environments (turn-taking samples). The
third sample (high-activity) gave us insight into children's productive
speech abilities, but is discussed elsewhere (Casillas, in progress).

The turn-taking and high-activity clips were chosen by two trained
annotators (the first author and a student assistant) who listened to
each recording in its entirety at 1--2x speed while actively taking
notes about potentially useful clips. Afterwards, the first author
reviewed the list of candidate clips, listened again to each one (at 1x
speed with multiple repetitions), and chose the best five 1-minute
samples for each of the two types of activity. Good turn-taking activity
was defined as closely timed sequences of contingent vocalization
between the target child and at least one other person (i.e., frequent
vocalization exchanges). The \enquote{best} turn-taking clips were
chosen because they had the most and most clear turn-switching activity
between the target child and the other speaker(s). Good vocal activity
clips were defined as clips in which the target child produced the most
and most diverse spontaneous (i.e., not imitative) vocalizations. The
\enquote{best} vocal activity clips were chosen for representing the
most linguistically mature and/or diverse vocalizations made by the
child over the day. All else being equal, candidate clips were
prioritized when they contained less background noise or featured
speakers and speech that were not otherwise frequently represented
(e.g., CDS from older males). The best turn-taking clips and vocal
activity clips often overlapped; turn-taking clips were selected from
the list of candidates first, and then vocal-activity clips were chosen
from the remainder. Again, these manually selected clips were chosen
from audio that did not overlap with the initial \enquote{random} clip
selection. Therefore the true peak turn-taking and vocal-activity clips
for the day could possibly occur during the random clips---the manually
selected samples are the best examples from the remaining 8--10 hours of
audio. The instructions for manually selecting clips and the notes from
our Tseltal clip selection can be found at

The first author and a native speaker of Tseltal jointly transcribed and
annotated each clip in ELAN (Wittenburg, Brugman, Russel, Klassmann, \&
Sloetjes, 2006) using the ACLEW Annotation Scheme (Casillas et al.,
2017). The native Tseltal speaker lives in the community and knows most
of the recorded families personally. The annotations include the
transcription of (nearly) all hearable utterances in Tseltal, a loose
translation of each utterance into Spanish, vocal maturity measures of
each target child utterance (non-linguistic vocalizations/non-canonical
babbling/non-word canonical babbling/single words/multiple words), and
addressee annotations for all non-target-child utterances
(target-child-directed/other-child-directed/adult-directed/adult-and-child-directed/animal-directed/other-speaker-type-directed).
We annotated each utterance for intended addressee using contextual
interactional information from the photos, audio, and
preceding/following footage; we used an \enquote{unsure} category for
utterances with no clear classification.\footnote{Full documentation,
  including training materials, for the ACLEW Annotation Scheme can be
  found at \url{https://osf.io/b2jep/wiki/home/}.} We exported each ELAN
file as tab-separated values for all analysis.

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{methods-analysisinfo}

Our aim in this paper is to describe the quantitative characteristics of
Tseltal children's speech environments, as captured by the nine randomly
selected five-minute clips from each child. We analyze five measures of
children's speech environment: rate of target-child-directed speech
(TCDS min/hr) and rate of other-directed speech (ODS min/hr), the rate
of target-child-to-other turn transitions (TC--O transitions/min) and
other-to-target-child turn transitions (O--TC transitions/min), and the
duration of the target child's interactional sequences in seconds. For
each of these five measures we investigate the effects of child age,
time of day, household size, and number of speakers present. We then
briefly report on a comparative analysis modelind the same effects on
these five measures in the high turn-taking clips. We wrap up with two
descriptive analyses: an initial estimate of the amount of time Tseltal
children spend in high turn-taking interaction over the course of an
entire day and an outline of the trajectory for early vocal maturity.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}

Unless otherwise stated, all analyses were conducted with generalized
linear mixed-effects regressions using the glmmTMB package and all plots
are generate with ggplot2 in R (Brooks et al., 2017a; R Core Team, 2018;
Wickham, 2009).\footnote{The data and analysis code are freely available
  on the web ({[}retracted for review{]}), as is a summary of the
  results which will be updated as more transcriptions become available
  ({[}retracted for review{]}).} Notably, all five speech environment
measures are restricted to non-negative values (min/hr, turn
transitions/min, and duration in seconds), with a subset of them also
displaying extra cases of zero in the randomly sampled clips (min/hr,
turn transitions/min; e.g., when the child is napping). The consequence
of these boundary restrictions is that the variance of the distributions
becomes non-gaussian (i.e., a long right tail). We account for this
issue by using negative binomial regression, whish is useful for
overdispersed count data (Brooks et al., 2017b; Smithson \& Merkle,
2013). When extra cases of zero are present due to, e.g., no speakers
being present, we used a zero-inflation negative binomial regression,
which creates two models: (a) a binary model to evaluate the likelihood
of none vs.~some presence of the variable (e.g., TCDS) and (b) a count
model of the variable (e.g., \enquote{3} vs. \enquote{5} TCDS min/hr),
using the negative binomial distribution as the linking function.
Alternative analyses using gaussian models with logged dependent
variables are available in the Supplementary Materials, but are
qualitatively similar to the results we report here.

Our primary predictors were as follows: child age (months), household
size (number of people), and number of non-target-child speakers present
in that clip, all centered and standardized, plus squared time of day at
the start of the clip (in decimal hours; centered on noon and
standardized). We always used squared time of day to model the cycle of
activity at home: the mornings and evenings should be more similar to
each other than midday because people tend to disperse for chores after
breakfast. To this we also added two-way interactions between child age
and number of speakers present, household size, and time of day.
Finally, we included a random effect of child, with random slopes of
time of day, unless doing so resulted in model non-convergence. Finally,
for the zero-inflation models, we included child age, number of speakers
present, and time of day. We have noted below when models needed to
deviate from this core design to achieve convergence. We only report
significant effects here; full model outputs are available in the
Supplementary Materials.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Target-child-directed speech
(TCDS)}\label{target-child-directed-speech-tcds}

The Tseltal children in our study were directly spoken to for an average
of 3.63 minutes per hour in the random sample (median = 4.08; range =
0.83--6.55; \protect\hyperlink{fig3}{Figure 3}). These estimates are
close to those reported for Yucatec Mayan data (Shneidman \&
Goldin-Meadow, 2012), which are plotted with our data, along with
estimates from a few other populations in
\protect\hyperlink{fig4}{Figure 4} (US/Canada: Bergelson et al., 2018b;
Tsimane: Scaff et al., in preparation, see {\textbf{???}} for a more
detailed comparison; US urban and Yukatek: Shneidman, 2010; Mozambique
urban and rural, and Dutch: Vogt et al., 2015).\footnote{We convert the
  original estimates from Shneidman (2010) into min/hr by using the
  median utterance duration in our dataset for all non-target child
  speakers: (1029ms). Note that, though this conversion is far from
  perfect, Yukatek and Tseltal are related languages.}. We modeled TCDS
min/hr in the random clips with a zero-inflated negative binomial
regression, as described above.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig4-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig4}TCDS rate reported from daylong recordings made in
different populations, including both urban (gray) and rural/indigenous
(black) samples. Each point is the average TCDS rate reported for
children at the indicated age, and size indicates number of children
sampled (range: 1--26). See text for references to original studies.}
\end{figure}

The rate of TCDS in the randomly sampled clips was primarily affected by
factors relating to the time of day. The count model showed that,
overall, children were more likely to hear TCDS in the mornings and
evenings than around midday (B = 4.32, SD = 1.92, z = 2.25, p = 0.02).
However, this pattern weakened for older children, some of whom even
heard peak TCDS input around midday, as illustrated in
\protect\hyperlink{fig5}{Figure 5} (B = -5.22, SD = 1.97, z = -2.64, p =
0.01). There were no significant effects of child age, household size,
or number of speakers present, no significant effects in the
zero-inflation model.\footnote{This TCDS zero-inflation did not include
  the number of speakers present or time of day.}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig5-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig5}TCDS rate heard at different times of day by
children 12 months and younger (left) and 13 months and older (right) in
the randomly selected (purple) and turn-taking (green) clips.}
\end{figure}

In contrast to findings from Shneidman and Goldin-Meadow (2012) on
Yucatec Mayan, most TCDS in the current data came from adult speakers
(mean = 80.61\%, median = 87.22\%, range = 45.90\%--100), with no
evidence for an increase in proportion TCDS from children with target
child age (correlation between child age and proportion TCDS from
children: Spearman's \emph{rho} = -0.29; \emph{p} = 0.42).

\subsection{Other-directed speech
(ODS)}\label{other-directed-speech-ods}

Children heard an average of 21.05 minutes per hour in the random sample
(median = 17.80; range = 3.57--42.80): that is, 5--6 times as much
speech as was directed to them. We modeled ODS min/hr in the random
clips with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression, as described
above.

The count model of ODS in the randomly selected clips revealed that the
presence of more speakers was strongly associated with more ODS (B =
1.06, SD = 0.09, z = 11.54, p = 0). Additionally, more ODS occurred in
the mornings and evenings (B = 2.70, SD = 1.14, z = 2.36, p = 0.02), and
was also more frequent in large households for older children compared
to younger children (B = 0.33, SD = 0.16, z = 2.01, p = 0.04). There
were no other significant effects on ODS rate, and no significant
effects in the zero-inflation models.\footnote{This ODS count model did
  not include by-child intercepts of time of day and its zero-inflation
  did not include the number of speakers present.}

Other-directed speech may have been so common because there were an
average 3.44 speakers present other than the target child in the
randomly selected clips (median = 3; range = 0--10), and (typically)
more than half of the speakers were adults. However, these estimates may
be comparable to North American infants (6--7 months) living in nuclear
family homes (Bergelson et al., 2018a), so a high incidence of ODS may
be common for infants in many sociocultural contexts.

\begin{figure}

Light gray boxes indicate TCDS and dark gray boxes indicate ODS.}\label{fig:fig6}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Target-child-to-other turn transitions
(TC--O)}\label{target-child-to-other-turn-transitions-tco}

We detect contingent turn exchanges between the target child and other
speakers based on turn timing \protect\hyperlink{fig6}{Figure 6}. If a
child's vocalization is followed by a target-child-directed utterance
within -1000--2000msec of the end of the child's vocalization (Casillas,
Bobb, \& Clark, 2016; Hilbrink, Gattis, \& Levinson, 2015), it is
counted as a contingent response (i.e., a TC--O transition). We use the
same idea to find other-to-target-child transitions below (i.e., a
target-child-directed utterance followed by a target child vocalization
with the same overlap/gap restrictions). Each target child vocalization
can only have one prompt and one response and each target-child-directed
utterance can maximally count once as a prompt and once as a response
(e.g., in a TC--O--TC sequence, the \enquote{O} is both a response and a
prompt).

Gap and overlap restrictions are based on prior studies of infant and
young children's turn taking (Casillas et al., 2016; Hilbrink et al.,
2015), though the timing margins are increased slightly for the current
dataset because the prior estimates come from relatively short, intense
bouts of interaction in WEIRD parental contexts. Note, too, that much
prior work has used maximum gaps of similar or greater length to detect
verbal contingencies in caregiver-child interaction; and any work based
on LENA\^{}TM conversational blocks is thereby based on a 5-second
silence maximum (Bergelson et al., 2018b; M. H. Bornstein, Putnick,
Cote, Haynes, \& Suwalsky, 2015; Broesch, Rochat, Olah, Broesch, \&
Henrich, 2016; Egeren, Barratt, \& Roach, 2001; Y. Kuchirko, Tafuro, \&
Tamis-LeMonda, 2018; Romeo et al., 2018); in comparison our timing
restrictions are quite stringent.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig7-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig7}By-child estimates of contingent responses per
minute to the target child's vocalizations (left), contingent responses
per minute by the target child to others' target-child-directed speech
(middle), and the average duration of contingent interactional sequences
(right). Each datapoint represents the value for a single clip within
the random (purple; solid) or turn taking (green; dashed) samples. Bands
on the solid linear trends show 95\% CIs.}
\end{figure}

Other speakers responded contingently to the target children's
vocalizations at an average rate of 1.38 transitions per minute (median
= 0.40; range = 0--8.60). We modeled TC--O transtions per minute in the
random clips with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression, as
described above.

The rate at which children hear contingent response from others was
primarily influenced by factors relating to the child's age. Older
children heard more contingent responses then younger children when
there were more speakers present (B = 0.47, SD = 0.22, z = 2.11, p =
0.03). Also, as with the speech quantity measures, younger children
heard more contingent responses in the mornings and evenings while this
effect was less pronounced for older children (B = -6.46, SD = 2.56, z =
-2.52, p = 0.01).There were no other significant effects on TC--O
transition rate, and no significant effects in the zero-inflation model
either.\footnote{This TC--O transition count model did not include
  by-child intercepts of time of day.}

\subsection{Other-to-target-child turn transitions
(O--TC)}\label{other-to-target-child-turn-transitions-otc}

Tseltal children responded contingently to others' target-child
vocalizations at an average rate of 1.17 transitions per minute (median
= 0.20; range = 0--8.80). We modeled O--TC transtions per minute in the
random clips with a zero-inflated negative binomial regression, as
described above.

The rate at which children respond contingently to others (O--TC turn
transitions per minute) was similarly influenced by child age and time
of day: older children were less likely than young children to show peak
response rates in the morning and evening (B = -7.30, SD = 2.61, z =
-2.80, p = 0.01). There were no further significant effects in the count
or zero-inflation models.\footnote{This O--TC transition count model did
  not include by-child intercepts of time of day.}

\subsection{Sequence duration}\label{sequence-duration}

Sequences of interaction include periods of contingent turn taking with
at least one target child vocalization and one target-child-directed
prompt or response from another speaker. We use the same mechanism as
before to detect contingent TC--O and O--TC transitions, but also allow
for speakers to continue with multiple vocalizations in a row (e.g.,
TC--O--O--TC--OTH; \protect\hyperlink{fig7}{Figure 7}. Sequences are
bounded by the earliest and latest vocalization for which there is no
contingent prompt/response, respectively. Each target child vocalization
can only appear in one sequence, and many sequences have more than one
child vocalization. Because sequence durations were not zero-inflated,
we modeled them in the random clips with negative binomial regression.

We detected 311 interactional sequences in the 90 randomly selected
clips, with an average sequence duration of 10.13 seconds (median = 7;
range = 0.56--85.47). The average number of child vocalizations within
these sequences was 3.75 (range = 1--29; median = 3). None of the
predictors significantly impacted sequence duration (all \emph{p}
\textgreater{} 0.09).\footnote{This sequence duration model did not
  include by-child intercepts of time of day.}

\subsection{Peak interaction}\label{peak-interaction}

As expected, the turn-taking clips featured a much higher rate of
contingent turn transitions: the average TC--O transition rate was 7.73
transitions per minute (median = 7.80; range = 0--25) and the average
O--TC rate was 7.56 transitions per minute (median = 6.20; range =
0--26). The interactional sequences were also longer on average: 12.27
seconds (median = 8.10; range = 0.55--61.22).

Crucially, children also heard much more TCDS in the turn-taking
clips---13.28 min/hr (median = 13.65; range = 7.32--20.19)---while also
hearing less ODS---11.93 min/hr (median = 10.18; range = 1.37--24.42).

We modeled each of these five speech environment measures with parallel
models to those used above (with no zero-inflation model for TCDS,
TC--O, and O--TC rates, given the nature of the sample). The impact of
child age, time of day, household size, and number of speakers was
qualitatively similar (basic sample comparisons are visualized in
\protect\hyperlink{fig3}{Figure 3}, \protect\hyperlink{fig4}{Figure 4},
and \protect\hyperlink{fig6}{Figure 6}) between the randomly selected
clips and these peak periods of interaction with the following
exceptions: older children heard significantly less ODS (B = -0.47, SD =
0.20, z = -2.39, p = 0.02), the presence of more speakers significantly
decreased children's response rate to other's vocalizations (B = -0.26,
SD = 0.12, z = -2.19, p = 0.03), and children's interactional sequences
were shorter for older children (B = -0.24, SD = 0.10, z = -2.42, p =
0.02), shorter for children in large households (B = -0.21, SD = 0.10, z
= -2.25, p = 0.02), and longer during peak periods in the mornings and
afternoons (B = 2.76, SD = 1.11, z = 2.50, p = 0.01). Full model outputs
can be compared in the Supplementary Materials.

\subsubsection{Peak minutes in the day}\label{peak-minutes-in-the-day}

We used these interactional characteristics to find similar
\enquote{high turn taking} minutes in the random samples in order to
extrapolate to the number of high interactivity minutes in the whole
day. To do this, we scanned each 60-second window (e.g., 0--60 sec,
1--61 sec, etc.\footnote{60 seconds is the smallest clip sample size in
  the turn-taking segments}) of each random clip from each child and
recorded the observed turn-transition rate. Only 6 of the 10 children
showed at least one minute of their random sample that equalled or
exceeded the grand average turn-transition rate (12.89 transitions per
minute), and 7 of the 10 children showed at least one minute equalling
or exceeding their own average turn transition rate from their
turn-taking samples, as shown in \protect\hyperlink{fig8}{Figure 8}.
Across children who did show turn-taking \enquote{peaks} in their random
data (i.e., at or above rates from the sample-average from the
turn-taking segments), periods of \enquote{peak} interaction were
relatively long, ranging in duration from an average of 0 to 103 seconds
across the 6 children with such peaks.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig8-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig8}Turn-transitions rates, estimated over the last 60
seconds for each second of the random samples by child (nine 5-min clips
each). The horizontal line indicates the group mean turn-transition rate
in the turn-taking sample. The large points indicate the by-child mean
turn-transition rate in the turn-taking sample.}
\end{figure}

Assuming approximately 12 waking hours, we therefore very roughly
estimate that these Tseltal children spent an average of 100.16 minutes
(1.67 hours) in high turn-taking, dyadic interaction during their
recording day. However, the range in the quantity of high turn-taking
interaction varies enormously across children, starting at just a few
minutes per day and topping out at more than 419.73 minutes (7 hours) in
our sample.

\subsection{Vocal maturity}\label{vocal-maturity}

Is there room for quick vocmat findings here? See
\protect\hyperlink{fig9}{Figure 9}.

anticipated by the intro.
