  \abstract{We analyzed 9--11-hour at-home audio recordings from 10 Tseltal Mayan
children between 0;2 and 3;0 to investigate how often they engaged in
verbal interaction with others and whether their speech environment
changed with age, time of day, household size, and number of speakers
present. We found that Tseltal children are not often directly spoken
to, that most directed speech comes from adults, and that directed
speech does not increase with age. Most of children's directed speech
came in the mornings or early evenings, particularly for younger
children, and high interactional peaks tended to occur in
\textasciitilde{}1-minute bursts of turn taking. These findings only
partly support previous characterizations of Mayan caregiver-child talk.
An initial analysis of children's vocal development suggests that,
despite relatively little directed speech, these children develop early
language skills on a similar timescale to American English-learning
children. Given the present findings, we discuss multiple proposals for
how Tseltal children might be efficient learners.}

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

A great deal of work in developmental language science revolves around
one central question: what linguistic evidence is needed to support
first language acquisition? In pursuing this topic, many researchers
have fixed their sights on the quantity and characteristics of speech
addressed to children (e.g., Golinkoff, Can, Soderstrom, \& Hirsh-Pasek,
2015; Hoff, 2006). In several languages, child-directed speech
(CDS\footnote{Throughout this article, we use \enquote{child-directed
  speech} and \enquote{CDS} in the most literal sense: speech designed
  for and directed toward a child recipient.}) has been demonstrated to
be distinct from adult-directed speech (ADS) in that it is
linguistically adapted for young listeners (Cristia, 2013; Soderstrom,
2007), interactionally rich (Bruner, 1983; Butterworth, 2003), preferred
by infants (Cooper \& Aslin, 1990; ManyBabies Collaborative, 2017; Segal
\& Newman, 2015), and appears to facilitate early word learning
(Cartmill et al., 2013; Hoff, 2003; Hurtado, Marchman, \& Fernald, 2008;
Rowe, 2008; Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013). However, ethnographic reports
from a number of traditional, non-Western communities suggest that
children easily acquire their language(s) even when they are only
infrequently directly addressed (Brown, 2011). If so, frequent CDS may
not be essential for learning language; just useful for facilitating
certain aspects of language development. In this paper we investigate
the language environment and early vocal development of 10 Tseltal Mayan
children growing up in a community where caregivers have previously been
reported to infrequently directly address speech to young children
(Brown, 1998b, 2011, 2014).

\subsection{Child-directed speech}\label{intro-cds}

Prior work in Western contexts has shown that the amount of CDS children
hear influences their language development; more CDS is associated with
faster-growing receptive and productive vocabularies (e.g., Hart \&
Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003; Ramírez-Esparza, García-Sierra, \& Kuhl, 2014;
Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012), faster lexical retrieval (Hurtado et
al., 2008; Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013), and faster syntactic development
(Huttenlocher, Waterfall, Vasilyeva, Vevea, \& Hedges, 2010). Given that
CDS is designed for a child hearer, it is more likely than ADS or
other-directed speech to align with the child's attention, and may
thereby comparatively facilitate early language development. There are,
however, a few significant caveats to this body of work relating CDS
quantity and language development.

First, while there is overwhelming evidence linking CDS quantity to
vocabulary size, links to grammatical development are more scant (but
see Brinchmann, Braeken, \& Lyster, 2019; Frank, Braginsky, Marchman, \&
Yurovsky, in preparation; Huttenlocher et al., 2010). While the
advantage of CDS for referential word learning is clear, it is less
obvious how it facilitates syntactic learning (see also Yurovsky, 2018).
On the other hand, there is a wealth of evidence that syntactic
knowledge is lexically specified (e.g., Goldberg, 2003; Lieven, Pine, \&
Baldwin, 1997), and that, crosslinguistically, children's vocabulary
size is one of the most robust predictors of their early syntactic
development (Bates \& Goodman, 1997; Frank et al., in preparation;
Marchman, Martínez-Sussmann, \& Dale, 2004)---what is good for the
lexicon may also be good for syntax. For now, a direct link between CDS
and grammatical development still needs further exploration .

Second, most work on CDS quantity uses summary measures that average
over the ebb and flow of the day (e.g., average proportion CDS). In
reality, verbal behaviors are highly structured during interaction:
while some occur at regular intervals , others occur in shorter, more
intense bursts separated by long periods of inactivity . Infants' and
adults' vocal behavior is clustered across multiple time scales of
daylong recordings (Abney, Smith, \& Yu, 2017) and noun and verb use is
bursty across languages (Blasi, Schikowski, Moran, Pfeiler, \& Stoll, in
preparation). Even in experimental settings, two-year-olds have been
shown to learn novel words better from a massed presentation of object
labels versus a distributed one (Schwab \& Lew-Williams, 2016). The
existence of multi-scale temporal structure in children's language
experience implies new roles for attention and memory in development;
more work is needed to know how CDS is distributed over children's daily
experiences (Soderstrom \& Wittebolle, 2013).

Finally, prior work has typically focused on Western (primarily North
American) populations, limiting our ability to generalize effects of CDS
quantity (Brown \& Gaskins, 2014; Henrich, Heine, \& Norenzayan, 2010;
Lieven, 1994; M. Nielsen, Haun, Kärtner, \& Legare, 2017). While we gain
valuable insight by looking at within-population variation (e.g.,
different socioeconomic groups), we can more effectively find places
where our assumptions break down by studying new populations. Linguistic
anthropologists working in non-Western communities have long reported
that caregiver interaction styles vary immensely from place to place,
with some caregivers using little child-directed speech (Brown \&
Gaskins, 2014; Gaskins, 2006; Lieven, 1994; Ochs \& Schieffelin, 1984).
Children in these communities reportedly acquire language with
\enquote{typical}-looking benchmarks. For example, they start pointing
and talking around the same time we would expect for Western
middle-class infants (Brown, 2011, 2014; Brown \& Gaskins, 2014;
Liszkowski, Brown, Callaghan, Takada, \& De Vos, 2012; but see Salomo \&
Liszkowski, 2013). These findings have had little impact on mainstream
theories of language development, partly due to a lack of directly
comparable methods (Brown, 2014; Brown \& Gaskins, 2014). If, however,
children in these communities do acquire language without delay, despite
infrequent CDS, developmental language science would need to re-work
current ideas about the precise role of CDS quantity in early language
development.

Developmental language research using modern psycholinguistic methods
has supported the idea that children in some indigenous, non-Western
communities hear very little CDS. Scaff, Cristia, and colleagues (2017;
in preparation) estimate based on daylong recordings that Tsimane
children, growing up in a forager-horticulturalist population in the
Bolivian lowlands, hear maximally \textasciitilde{}4.8 minutes of CDS
per hour between 0;6 and 3;0 (Cristia et al., 2017; Scaff et al., in
preparation; see also Mastin and Vogt (2016) and Vogt, Mastin, and
Schots (2015)).

Shneidman and colleagues (2010; 2012) analyzed speech from one-hour
at-home video recordings of children between 1;0 and 3;0 in a Yucatec
Mayan and a North American community. Their analyses yielded four main
findings: compared to the American children, (a) Yucatec children heard
many fewer utterances per hour, (b) a much smaller proportion of the
utterances they heard were child-directed, (c) the proportion of
utterances that were child-directed increased dramatically with age,
matching U.S. children's CDS proportion by 3;0, and (d) most of the
added CDS came from other children (e.g., older siblings/cousins). The
lexical diversity of the CDS Yucatec Mayan children heard at 24
months---particularly from adult speakers---predicted their vocabulary
knowledge at 35 months, suggesting that CDS characteristics still played
a role in that non-Western indigenous context.

\subsection{The current study}\label{intro-currentstudy}

We examine the early language experience of 10 Tseltal Mayan children
under age 3;0. Prior ethnographic work suggests that Tseltal caregivers
do not frequently use CDS until the children themselves begin to
actively initiate verbal interactions (Brown, 2011, 2014). Nonetheless,
Tseltal children develop language with no apparent delays (Brown, 2011,
2014; Liszkowski et al., 2012; see also Pye, 2017). We provide more
details on the community and dataset in the
\protect\hyperlink{methods}{Methods section}. We analyze five basic
measures of Tseltal children's language environments including: (a) the
quantity of speech directed to them, (b) the quantity of other-directed
speech they could potentially overhear, (c) the rate of contingent
responses to their vocalizations, (d) the rate of their contingent
responses to others' vocalizations, and (e) the duration of their
interactional dyadic sequences. We then also roughly estimate the number
of minutes per day children spent in \enquote{high turn-taking}
interaction and outline a basic trajectory for their early vocal
development.

Based on prior work, we predicted that Tseltal Mayan children would be
infrequently directly addressed, that the amount of CDS and contingent
responses they heard would increase with age, that most CDS would come
from other children, and that, despite this, their early vocal
development would be on par with Western children. We additionally
predicted that children's language environments would be bursty---that
high-intensity interactions would be brief and sparsely distributed
throughout the day, accounting for the majority of children's daily CDS.

\hypertarget{methods}{\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\subsection{Corpus}\label{methods-dataset}

The children in this dataset come from a small-scale, subsistence
farming community in the highlands of Chiapas (Southern Mexico). The
vast majority of children grow up speaking Tseltal monolingually at
home. Nuclear families are typically organized into patrlinieal clusters
of large, multi-generation households. More than forty years of
ethnographic work by the second author has supported the idea that
Tseltal children's language environments are non-child-centered and
non-object-centered (Brown, 1998b, 2011, 2014). During their waking
hours, infants are typically tied to their mother's back while she goes
about her work for the day. When not on their mother's back, young
children are often cared for by other family members, especially older
siblings. Typically, CDS is limited until children themselves begin to
initiate interactions, usually around age 1;0. Interactional exchanges,
when they do occur, are often brief or non-verbal (e.g., object exchange
routines) and take place within a multi-participant context (Brown,
2014). Interactions tend to focus on appropriate actions and responses
(not on words and their meanings), and young children are socialized to
attend the events taking place around them (see also de León, 2000,
2011; Rogoff, Paradise, Arauz, Correa-Chávez, \& Angelillo, 2003). By
age five, most children are competent speakers who engage in daily
chores and the caregiving of their younger siblings. The Tseltal
approach to caregiving is similar to that described for other Mayan
communities (de León, 2011; Gaskins, 1996, 1999; e.g., León, 1998; Pye,
1986; Rogoff et al., 1993, 2003; Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012).

The current data come from the Casillas HomeBank Corpus (Casillas,
Brown, \& Levinson, 2017; VanDam et al., 2016), which includes daylong
recordings and other developmental language data from more than 100
children under 4;0 across two indigenous, non-Western communities: the
Tseltal Mayan community described here and a Papua New Guinean community
described elsewhere (Brown, 2011, 2014; Brown \& Casillas, in press).
This Tseltal corpus, primarily collected in 2015, includes recordings
from 55 children born to 43 mothers. The participating families
typically only had 2--3 children (median = 2; range = 1--9), due to the
fact that they come from a young subsample of the community (mothers:
mean = 26.3 years; median = 25; range = 16--43 and fathers: mean = 30;
median = 27; range = 17---52). Based on data from living children, we
estimate that, on average, mothers were 20 years old when they had their
first child (median = 19; range = 12--27), with a following inter-child
interval of 3 years (median = 2.8; range = 1--8.5). As a result, 28\% of
the participating families had two children under 4;0. To our knowledge
at time of recording, all children were typically developing. Note that
all ages should be taken with a grain of salt because documentation of
birthdates in the village is not rigorous. Household size, defined in
our dataset as the number of people sharing a kitchen or other primary
living space, ranged between between 3 and 15 people (mean = 7.2; median
= 7). Although 32.7\% of the target children are first-born, they were
rarely the only child in their household. Most mothers had finished
primary (37\%) or secondary (30\%) school, with a few more having
completed preparatory school (12\%) or university (2\%; 1 mother); the
remainder (23\%) had no schooling or did not complete primary school.
All fathers had finished primary school, with most completing secondary
school (44\%) or preparatory school (21\%), and two completing a
university-level training (5\%). While 93\% of the fathers grew up in
the village where the recordings took place, only 53\% of the mothers
did because of the way clan membership influences marriage and land
inheritance.

We used a novel combination of a lightweight stereo audio recorder
(Olympus WS-832) and wearable photo camera (Narrative Clip 1) fitted
with a fish-eye lens to track children's interactions over the course of
a 9--11-hour period at home in which the experimenter was not present.
Ambulatory children wore both devices at once (see
\protect\hyperlink{fig1}{Figure 1}) while other children wore the
recorder in a onesie while their primary caregiver wore the camera on an
elastic vest. The camera was set to take photos at 30-second intervals
and was synchronized to the audio in post-processing to generate
snapshot-linked audio.\footnote{Post-processing scripts are available at
  \url{https://github.com/marisacasillas/Weave}.} We used these
recordings to capture a wide range of the linguistic patterns children
encounter as they participate in different activities over the course of
their day (Bergelson, Amatuni, Dailey, Koorathota, \& Tor, 2018;
Greenwood, Thiemann-Bourque, Walker, Buzhardt, \& Gilkerson, 2011;
Catherine S. Tamis-LeMonda, Kuchirko, Luo, Escobar, \& Bornstein, 2017).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Data selection and annotation}\label{methods-samples}

We chose 10 children's recordings based on maximimal spread in child age
(0;0--3;0), child sex, and maternal education (see
\protect\hyperlink{tab1}{Table 1}; all had native Tseltal-speaking
parents). We selected one hour's worth of non-overlapping clips from
each recording in the following order: nine randomly selected 5-minute
clips, five manually selected 1-minute top \enquote{turn-taking} clips,
five manually selected 1-minute top \enquote{vocal activity} clips, and
one, manually selected 5-minute extension of the best 1-minute clip (see
\protect\hyperlink{fig2}{Figure 2}). We created these different
subsamples to measure properties of (a) children's \emph{average}
language environments (\enquote{Random}), (b) their most
\emph{input-dense} language environments (\enquote{Turn-taking}), and
(c) their most \emph{mature vocal behavior} (\enquote{Vocal activity}).

\begin{table}[tbp]

\end{tabular}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The turn-taking and high-activity clips were chosen by two trained
annotators (the first author and a student assistant) who listened to
each recording in its entirety at 1--2x speed while actively taking
notes about potentially useful clips. The first author then reviewed the
list of candidate clips and chose the best five 1-minute samples for
each of the two activity types. Note that, because the manually selected
clips did not overlap with the initial \enquote{random} clip selection,
the \enquote{true} peak turn-taking and vocal-activity clips for the day
could have possibly occurred during the random clips. High-quality
turn-taking activity was defined as closely timed sequences of
contingent vocalization between the target child and at least one other
person (i.e., frequent vocalization exchanges). High-quality vocal
activity clips were defined as clips in which the target child produced
the most and most diverse spontaneous (i.e., not imitative)
vocalizations (see full instructions at \url{https://git.io/fhdUm}).

\caption{\label{fig:fig2}Recording duration (black line) and sampled clips
(colored boxes) for each of the 10 recordings analyzed, sorted by child
age.}
\end{figure}

The first author and a native speaker of Tseltal who knows all the
recorded families personally jointly transcribed and annotated each clip
in ELAN (Wittenburg, Brugman, Russel, Klassmann, \& Sloetjes, 2006)
using the ACLEW Annotation Scheme (Casillas et al., 2017).
Utterance-level annotations include: an orthographic transcription
(Tseltal), a loose translation (Spanish), a vocal maturity rating for
each target child utterance (non-linguistic/non-canonical
babbling/canonical babbling/single words/multiple words), and the
intended addressee type for all non-target-child utterances
(target-child/other-child/adult/adult-and-child/animal/other-speaker-type).
Intended addressee was detemined by using contextual and interactional
information from the photos, audio, and preceding/following footage;
utterances with no clear intended addressee were marked as
\enquote{unsure}. We annotated lexical utterances as single- or
multi-word based on the word boundaries provided by the single native
speaker who reviewed all transcription; Tseltal is a mildly
polysynthetic language so, on average, there is more than one morpheme
per word.\footnote{Documentation, including training materials can be
  found at \url{https://osf.io/b2jep/wiki/home/}.}

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{methods-analysisinfo}

In what follows we first describe Tseltal children's speech environments
based on the nine randomly selected 5-minute clips from each child,
including: the rate of target-child-directed speech (TCDS min/hr) and
rate of other-directed speech (ODS min/hr), the rate of
target-child-to-other turn transitions (TC--O transitions/min) and
other-to-target-child turn transitions (O--TC transitions/min), and the
duration of the target child's interactional sequences. We investigate
the effects of child age, time of day, household size, and number of
speakers present on each of these five measures. We next repeat these
analyses, only this time looking at the high turn-taking clips. We then
wrap up with two descriptive analyses: an initial estimate of the amount
of time Tseltal children spend in high turn-taking interaction over the
course of an entire day and a basic trajectory for early Tseltal vocal
development.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Statistical models}\label{statistical-models}

All analyses were conducted in R with generalized linear mixed-effects
regressions using the glmmTMB package, and all plots were generated with
ggplot2 (M. E. Brooks et al., 2017a; R Core Team, 2018; Wickham,
2009).\footnote{Data and analysis code can be found at
  \url{https://github.com/marisacasillas/Tseltal-CLE}.} Notably, all
five dependent measures are restricted to non-negative (0--infinity)
values. This implicit boundary restriction at zero causes the
distributional variance of our measures to become non-gaussian (i.e.,
with a long right tail). We handle this issue by using a negative
binomial linking function in the regression, which estimates a
dispersion parameter (in addition to the mean and variance) that allows
the model to more closely fit our non-negative, overdispersed data (M.
E. Brooks et al., 2017b; Smithson \& Merkle, 2013). When, in addition to
this, extra cases of zero were evident in the distribution (e.g., TCDS
min/hr was zero because children were alone), we also added a
zero-inflation model to the regression. A zero-inflation negative
binomial regression creates two models: (a) a binary model to evaluate
the likelihood of none vs.~some presence of the variable (e.g., no
vs.~some TCDS) and (b) a count model of the variable (e.g., \enquote{3}
vs. \enquote{5} TCDS min/hr), using the negative binomial distribution
as the linking function. Alternative analyses using gaussian
mixed-effects regressions with logged dependent variables are available
in the Supplementary Materials, but are qualitatively similar to the
results we report here.

Our primary predictors were as follows: child age (months), household
size (number of people), and number of non-target-child speakers present
in that clip, all centered and standardized, plus time of day at the
start of the clip (as a factor; morning: up until 11:00; midday:
11:00--13:00; and afternoon: 13:00 onwards). We also added two-way
interactions between child age and: (a) number of speakers present, (b)
household size, and (c) time of day. We also included a random effect of
child. For the zero-inflation models, we included number of speakers
present. We only report significant effects in the main text; full model
outputs are available in the Supplementary Materials.

\subsection{Target-child-directed speech
(TCDS)}\label{target-child-directed-speech-tcds}

\end{figure}

The children in our sample were directly spoken to for an average of
3.63 minutes per hour in the random sample (median = 4.08; range =
0.83--6.55; \protect\hyperlink{fig3}{Figure 3}). These estimates are
close to those reported for Yucatec Mayan children (Shneidman \&
Goldin-Meadow, 2012), as illustrated in \protect\hyperlink{fig4}{Figure
4} (see Scaff et al. (in preparation) for more detailed cross-language
comparisons).\footnote{We convert Shneidman (2010)'s utterance/hr
  estimates to min/hr with the median Tseltal utterance duration for
  non-target child speakers: (1029ms) because Yucatec and Tseltal are
  related languages.} We modeled TCDS min/hr in the random clips with a
zero-inflated negative binomial regression. The rate of TCDS in the
randomly sampled clips was primarily affected by factors relating to the
time of day (see \protect\hyperlink{fig5}{Figure 5}). The count model
showed that the children were more likely to hear TCDS in the mornings
than around midday (B = 0.82, SD = 0.40, z = 2.06, p = 0.04), with no
difference between morning and afternoon (p = 0.29) or midday and
afternoon (p = 0.19) TCDS rates. Time of day effects varied by age:
older children were significantly more likely to hear TCDS at midday (B
= 0.73, SD = 0.36, z = 2.04, p = 0.04) and marginally more likely to
hear it in the morning (B = 0.46, SD = 0.28, z = 1.65, p = 0.10)
compared to the afternoons. Older target children were also
significantly more likely to hear TCDS when more speakers were present,
compared to younger children (B = 0.61, SD = 0.20, z = 3.06, p = 0.00).
There were no significant effects of target child age or household size,
and no significant effects in the zero-inflation model.

different times of day in the random (top) and turn-taking (bottom) clip
samples by children age 1;0 and younger (light) and 1;0 and older
(dark).}
\end{figure}

In contrast to findings from Shneidman and Goldin-Meadow (2012) on
Yucatec Mayan, most TCDS in the current data came from adult speakers
(mean = 80.61\%, median = 87.22\%, range = 45.90\%--100\%), with no
evidence for an increase in proportion of TCDS from children with target
child age (Spearman's \emph{rho} = -0.29; \emph{p} = 0.42).

\subsection{Other-directed speech
(ODS)}\label{other-directed-speech-ods}

Children heard an average of 21.05 minutes of ODS per hour in the random
sample (median = 17.80; range = 3.57--42.80): that is, nearly six times
as much speech as was directed to them, on average. We modeled ODS
min/hr in the random clips with a zero-inflated negative binomial
regression. The count model of ODS in the randomly selected clips
revealed that the presence of more speakers was strongly associated with
more ODS (B = 0.65, SD = 0.09, z = 7.32, p \textless{} 0.0001). There
were an average of 3.44 speakers present other than the target child in
the randomly selected clips (median = 3; range = 0--10), more than half
of whom were typically adults. Older target children were also
significantly less likely to hear ODS in large households, compared to
younger children (B = 0.32, SD = 0.13, z = 2.41, p = 0.02).

Like TCDS, ODS was also strongly affected by time of day (see
\protect\hyperlink{fig5}{Figure 5}). Compared to midday, target children
were significantly more likely to hear ODS in the mornings (B = 0.36, SD
= 0.17, z = 2.09, p = 0.04) and marginally more likely to hear it in the
afternoons (B = 0.29, SD = 0.16, z = 1.89, p = 0.06), with no
significant difference between ODS rates in the mornings and afternoons
(p = 0.63). As before, ODS rate varied across the day by target child
age: older children were significantly more likely to hear ODS in the
afternoon than at midday (B = 0.38, SD = 0.17, z = 2.21, p = 0.03), with
no significant differences between afternoon and morning (p = 0.10) or
midday and morning (p = 0.63). There were no other significant effects
on ODS rate, and no significant effects in the zero-inflation models.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Target-child-to-other turn transitions
(TC--O)}\label{target-child-to-other-turn-transitions-tco}

Contingent responses by or to the target child are likely to occur at
moments in which the child and another speaker are attentionally
aligned; the rate at which these responses is an index of the frequency
of these joint moments of high-quality linguistic evidence. We measured
two types of contingent responses: target-child-to-other and
other-to-target-child. We detect these contingent turn transitions based
on utterance onset/offset times and the annotations of intended
addressee for each non-target-child utterance
(\protect\hyperlink{fig6}{Figure 6}). If a child's vocalization is
followed by a target-child-directed utterance within -1000msec to
2000msec after its end (Casillas, Bobb, \& Clark, 2016; Hilbrink,
Gattis, \& Levinson, 2015), it is counted as a contingent response
(i.e., a TC--O transition). We use the same idea to find
other-to-target-child transitions (i.e., a target-child-directed
utterance followed by a target child vocalization with the same timing
restrictions). In our analysis, each target child vocalization can have
maximally have one prompt and one response, and each
target-child-directed utterance can maximally count once as a prompt and
once as a response (e.g., in a TC--O--TC sequence, the \enquote{O} is
both a response and a prompt). These timing restrictions are broadly
based on prior studies of infant and young children's spontaneous turn
taking (e.g., M. H. Bornstein, Putnick, Cote, Haynes, \& Suwalsky, 2015;
T. Broesch, Rochat, Olah, Broesch, \& Henrich, 2016; Casillas et al.,
2016; Hilbrink et al., 2015).

(dark purple; solid) or turn taking (light green; dashed) samples for
each child. Bands on the linear trends show 95\% CIs.}
\end{figure}

Other speakers responded contingently to the target children's
vocalizations at an average rate of 1.38 transitions per minute (median
= 0.40; range = 0--8.60; \protect\hyperlink{fig7}{Figure 7}). We modeled
TC--O transtions per minute in the random clips with a zero-inflated
negative binomial regression. The rate at which target children heard
contingent responses from others was primarily influenced by factors
relating to target child age. The rate of contingent responses to target
child vocalizations varied across the day by target child age: older
children heard significantly more contingent responses around midday (B
= 1.08, SD = 0.44, z = 2.44, p = 0.01) and in the morning (B = 0.94, SD
= 0.37, z = 2.51, p = 0.01), compared to the afternoon, with no
significant difference between morning and midday (p = 0.77). Older
target children also heard significantly more contingent responses then
younger ones when there were more speakers present (B = 0.56, SD = 0.23,
z = 2.48, p = 0.01).There were no further significant effects in the
count or zero-inflation models.

\subsection{Other-to-target-child turn transitions
(O--TC)}\label{other-to-target-child-turn-transitions-otc}

The children in our sample responded contingently to others'
target-child vocalizations at an average rate of 1.17 transitions per
minute (median = 0.20; range = 0--8.80; \protect\hyperlink{fig7}{Figure
7}). We modeled O--TC transtions per minute in the random clips with a
zero-inflated negative binomial regression, excluding by-child
intercepts of time of day to achieve convergence. The rate at which
target children responded contingently to others (O--TC turn transitions
per minute) was similarly influenced by child age and time of day: older
children responded contingently to others' utterances significantly more
often around midday (B = 1.46, SD = 0.46, z = 3.13, p = 0.00) and in the
morning (B = 1.33, SD = 0.42, z = 3.19, p = 0.00), compared to the
afternoon, with no significant difference between morning and midday (p
= 0.81). Overall, older children responded to others' utterances at a
marginally higher rate (B = 1.14, SD = 0.66, z = 1.74, p = 0.08). Older
target children also gave significantly more contingent responses then
younger ones when there were more speakers present (B = 0.52, SD = 0.22,
z = 2.30, p = 0.02).There were no further significant effects in the
count or zero-inflation models.

\subsection{Sequence duration}\label{sequence-duration}

We defined sequences of interaction as periods of contingent turn taking
with at least one target child vocalization and one
target-child-directed prompt or response from another speaker. To detect
sequences of interaction, we used the same mechanism as before to detect
contingent TC--O and O--TC transitions, but also allowed for speakers to
continue with multiple vocalizations in a row (e.g., TC--O--O--TC--OTH;
\protect\hyperlink{fig6}{Figure 6}). We bounded sequences by the
earliest and latest vocalization for which there is no contingent prompt
or response, respectively. In our analysis, each target child
vocalization can only appear in one sequence. We modeled these sequence
durations in the random clips with negative binomial regression alone
(i.e., with no zero-inflation model). We detected 311 interactional
sequences in the 90 randomly selected clips, with an average sequence
duration of 10.13 seconds (median = 7; range = 0.56--85.47;
\protect\hyperlink{fig7}{Figure 7}). The average number of child
vocalizations within these sequences was 3.75 (range = 1--29; median =
3). None of the predictors significantly impacted sequence duration (all
\emph{p} \&ge 0.21).

\subsection{Speech environment characteristics at peak
interaction}\label{speech-environment-characteristics-at-peak-interaction}

As expected, the high-quality turn taking clips featured a much higher
rate of contingent turn transitions: the average TC--O transition rate
was 7.73 transitions per minute (\textasciitilde{}5.5x the random sample
rate; median = 7.80; range = 0--25) and the average O--TC rate was 7.56
transitions per minute (\textasciitilde{}6.5x the random sample rate;
median = 6.20; range = 0--26). The interactional sequences were also
slightly longer on average: 12.27 seconds (\textasciitilde{}1.2x the
random sample rate; median = 8.10; range = 0.55--61.22). Crucially,
children also heard much more TCDS in the turn-taking clips---13.28
min/hr (nearly 4x the random sample rate; median = 13.65; range =
7.32--20.19)---while also hearing less ODS---11.93 min/hr (nearly half
the random sample rate; median = 10.18; range = 1.37--24.42).

We analyzed each of these speech environment measures with parallel
models to those used for the random sample, though this time we did not
include a zero-inflation model for TCDS, TC--O, and O--TC rates---given
the criteria for selecting a turn-taking clip, the child is never alone,
and so there are no extra-zero cases. As a whole, children's speech
environments appeared very different when viewed through the lens of
interactional peaks rather than randomly sampled clips (see
\protect\hyperlink{fig3}{Figures 3}, \protect\hyperlink{fig5}{5}, and
\protect\hyperlink{fig7}{7}), particularly with respect to time of day
effects and the number of speakers present, which we focus on here. Full
model outputs are available in the Supplementary Materials.

Time-of-day effects were consistently weaker in the turn-taking sample.
TCDS rates showed no time-of-day effects and no interaction between
time-of-day and age, and ODS rates \emph{did} show a dip, but later in
the day than what we saw in the random sample (i.e., afternoon, not
midday; afternoon-vs.-midday: B = 0.70, SD = 0.29, z = 2.39, p = 0.02,
afternoon-vs.morning: B = 0.72, SD = 0.25, z = 2.91, p = 0.00). Older
children were also significantly more likely to hear ODS around midday
compared to the morning (B = -0.56, SD = 0.28, z = -1.99, p = 0.05), but
heard significantly less ODS overall than younger children (B = -0.45,
SD = 0.21, z = -2.19, p = 0.03). There were no time-of-day effects at
all on contingent response rates (TC--O and O--TC) in the turn-taking
sample. However, running counter to this overall pattern, sequence
duration in in the turn-taking sample did show significant time-of-day
effects not found in the random sample: sequences were significantly
longer in the afternoon compared to morning and midday
(afternoon-vs.-morning: B = -0.32, SD = 0.15, z = -2.12, p = 0.03;
afternoon-vs.-midday: B = 0.38, SD = 0.15, z = 2.61, p = 0.01).

Effects relating to the number of speakers present were also somewhat
weaker in the turn-taking sample, though inconsistently. In the random
sample, older children heard more TCDS, and participated in more
contingent responses (both TC--O and O--TC) when more speakers were
present, but this effect did not hold up in the turn-taking sample on
any of the three measures. On the other hand, the number of speakers
present was associated with significantly more ODS in both the random
and turn-taking samples (random sample: B = 0.71, SD = 0.11, z = 6.63, p
\textless{} 0.001), suggesting that the number of speakers is a robust
predictor of ODS quantity across different contexts.

\subsubsection{Peak minutes in the day}\label{peak-minutes-in-the-day}

Having now established the interactional timing characteristics of the
\enquote{high} turn-taking clips, we looked for similarly
temporally-contingent 1-minute sections of interaction in the random
samples in order to estimate the number of high interactivity minutes in
the whole day. To do this, we scanned each 60-second window (e.g., 0--60
sec, 1--61 sec, etc.) of each random clip and recorded the observed
turn-transition rate. We then compared the resulting 1-minute transition
rates to those typical for the high turn taking sample.

Only 6 of the 10 children showed at least one minute of their random
sample that equalled or exceeded the average contingent transition rate
(12.89 transitions/min), and 7 of the 10 children showed at least one
minute equalling or exceeding their \emph{own} average turn transition
rate from their turn-taking sample. Across the 6 children who did show
turn-taking \enquote{peaks} in their random data, peak periods were
relatively long, at an average of 88.95 seconds (median = 90.67 seconds;
range = 71--103 seconds). Assuming approximately 14 waking hours (Hart
\& Risley, 1995), we therefore very roughly estimate that the Tseltal
child spends an average of 116.85 minutes (1.95 hours) in high
turn-taking, dyadic interaction during their day. Importantly, however,
the range in the quantity of high turn-taking interaction varies
enormously across children, starting at just a few minutes per day and
topping out at more than 489.69 minutes (8.16 hours) in our sample. Much
more data, particularly from other Tseltal children in this age range,
is required to get a stable estimate of peak minutes in the day.

\subsection{Vocal maturity}\label{vocal-maturity}

Tseltal children's vocalizations appear to follow the normative
benchmarks for productive speech development, as typically characterized
by the onset of new production features. Decades of research in
post-industrial, typically Western populations has shown that,
typically, children begin producing non-canonical babbles around 0;2,
with canonical babbling appearing sometime around 0;7, first words
around 1;0, with first multi-word utterances appearing just after 1;6
(Fine \& Lieven, 1993; Frank et al., in preparation; P. K. Kuhl, 2004;
Slobin, 1970; Tomasello \& Brooks, 1999; Warlaumont \& Finnegan, 2016;
Warlaumont, Richards, Gilkerson, \& Oller, 2016). These benchmarks are
mirrored in the Tseltal children's vocalizations, which are summarized
in \protect\hyperlink{fig9}{Figure 9} based on all annotated
vocalizations from the random, turn-taking, and high vocal activity
samples (N = 4725 vocalizations). There is a decline in the use of
non-canonical babble and an accompanying increase in the use of
canonical babble from 0;6 to 1;0. Recognizable words are observed for
every child from age 11;0 and older. Multi-word utterances appear in all
recordings at 1;2 and later, making up 45\% of the oldest child's (3;0)
vocalizations.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Tseltal-CLE_files/figure-latex/fig9-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:fig9}Proportion of vocalization types used by children
across age (NCB = Non-canonical babble, CB = Canonical babble, SW =
single word utterance, MW = multi-word utterance).}
\end{figure}

These data are also consistent with usage statistics of speech-like
vocalizations by English-acquiring infants (Oller, 1980; Warlaumont \&
Finnegan, 2016; Warlaumont et al., 2016). Between 2 and 14 months, these
Tseltal children demonstrated a large increase in the proportion of
speech-like vocalizations (canonical babbling and lexical speech): from
9\% before 0;6 to 58\% between 0;10 and 1;2. Around age 1;0, their use
of speech-like vocalizations (58\%) is nearly identical to that
estimated by Warlaumont et al. (2016) for American children around age
1;0 in a variable SES sample (\textasciitilde{}60\%).\footnote{Speech-like
  vs.~non-speech-like comparisons are limited to age 1;6 in the ACLEW
  Annotation Scheme.}

\section{Discussion}\label{disc}

We analyzed 10 Tseltal Mayan children's speech environments in order to
estimate how often they have the opportunity to attend and respond to
speech. We found that, over the course of a whole recording day,
children were directly spoken to infrequently, but were often surrounded
by a large quantity of other-directed speech. The quantity of speech and
contingent responding in their environment appeared stable across the
first three years of life but was, over the course of individual
recordings, influenced by the time of day and number of speakers
present. When we focused on the speech quantity characteristics of
interactional peaks, we saw that many children received most of their
direct speech for the day in short, high-intensity bursts of
turn-taking. Speech quantities during these interactional peaks were
less affected by time of day and number of speakers present, suggesting
that there is at least one current of stable, reliable, high-engagement
linguistic interaction available to Tseltal children in the first few
years of life. The children's spontaneous vocal productions demonstrated
that, despite the relative infrequency of directly addressed speech,
Tseltal children's early vocal development was on-par with norms based
on post-industrial, typically Western populations. These findings only
partly replicate estimates of child language input and development in
previous work on Yucatec Mayan and Tseltal Mayan communities (Yucatec:
Shneidman et al., 2012; Shneidman, 2010; Tseltal: P. Brown, 1997, 1998,
2014, 2011), and bring new questions to light regarding the distribution
and sources of child-directed speech in Mayan children's speech
environments.

\subsection{Robust learning with less child-directed
speech}\label{robust-learning-with-less-child-directed-speech}

The bulk of our analyses were aimed at understanding how much speech
Tseltal children hear: we wanted to know how often they were directly
spoken to and how often they might have been able to listen to speech
directed to others. Consistent with prior work, the children were only
infrequently directly spoken to: an average of 3.63 minutes per hour in
the random sample. Compared to other studies based on daylong
recordings, the Tseltal average TCDS rate is approximately a third of
that found for North American children (Bergelson et al., 2019), but is
comparable to that for Tsimane children (Scaff et al., in preparation)
and Yucatec Mayan children (Shneidman, 2010; Shneidman, Arroyo, Levine,
\& Goldin-Meadow, 2012) in a similar age range. Meanwhile, we found that
the children had an enormous quantity of other-directed speech in their
environment, averaging 21.05 minutes per hour in the random sample,
which is more than has been previously reported for other cultural
settings (e.g., Bergelson et al., 2019; Scaff et al., in preparation).

We also created two novel interactive measures to describe how often
children were directly engaged with an interlocutor, either as a
responder or as an addressee being responded to. Children's
vocalizations were responded to at a rate of 1.38 transitions per minute
and children responded to others' child-directed vocalizations at a rate
of 1.17 transitions per minute. Contingent interaction (and the joint
attention that likely accompanies it) is a fertile context for language
learning because the participants' coordinated attentional states
decrease referential uncertainty, increase the chances of dynamic
feedback, and can spur further interactions (M. H. Bornstein et al.,
2015; T. Broesch et al., 2016; Warlaumont \& Finnegan, 2016; Warlaumont
et al., 2016). Because our measure is a novel one, we cannot directly
compare Tseltal children's data with those of children growing up in
other communities. That said, contingent responses are rare across the
day---more rare than CDS in general. The rarity of contingent responses
may be due to the fact that the children did not vocalize very often:
preliminary analyses showed that they only produced an average of 472.50
(median = 453; range = 245--753) vocalizations during their full one
hour of annotated audio (including the high vocal activity minutes), and
much of which was crying and laughter. Interestingly, although
interactional sequences were fairly long when they occurred (mean =
10.13 seconds), children tended to only vocalize 3.75 times per
sequence. In other words, many of children's dyadic
interactions---sometimes containing the bulk of their directed speech
for the day---are marked by longer streams of speech from an
interlocutor, interspersed with only occasional responses from the
child.

In sum, our daylong recording results confirm prior claims that Tseltal
children, like other Mayan children, are not often directly spoken to.
When they are, much of their speech comes in interactional sequences in
which children only play a minor part---directly contingent turn
transitions between children and their interlocutors are relatively
rare. However, we estimate that the average child under age 3;0
experiences more than one cumulative hour of high-intensity contingent
interaction with CDS per day. If child-directed speech quantity
monotonically feeds language development (such that more input begets
more (advanced) output), then the estimates presented here would lead us
to expect Tseltal to be delayed in their language development. However,
our analyses suggest that Tseltal children, though they do not vocalize
often, demonstrate vocal maturity comparable to children from societies
in which CDS is known to be more frequent (Fine \& Lieven, 1993; Frank
et al., in preparation; P. K. Kuhl, 2004; Slobin, 1970; Tomasello \&
Brooks, 1999; Warlaumont \& Finnegan, 2016; Warlaumont et al., 2016).
How might Tseltal children manage this feat?

\subsubsection{Other-directed speech}\label{other-directed-speech}

One proposal is that Mayan children become experts at learning from
observation during their daily interactions (de León, 2011; Rogoff et
al., 2003; Shneidman, 2010; Shneidman et al., 2012). In the randomly
selected clips, children were within hearing distance of other-directed
speech for an average of 21.05 minutes per hour. This large quantity of
ODS is likely due to the fact that Tseltal children tend to live in
households with more people compared to North American children
(Bergelson et al., 2018). In our data, the presence of more speakers was
associated with significantly more other-directed speech, both based on
the number of individual voices present in the clip and on the number of
people living in the household (for younger children). The presence of
more speakers had no overall impact on the quantity of TCDS children
experienced, but older children were more likely than younger children
to hear TCDS when more speakers were present. These findings ring true
with Brown's (2011, 2014) claim that Tseltal is a non-child-centric
language community; the presence of more people primarily increases talk
amongst the other speakers but, as children become more sophisticated
language users, they are more likely to participate in talk. However,
given that an increase in the number of speakers is also likely
associated with an increase in the amount of overlapping speech
(Cristia, Ganesh, Casillas, \& Ganapathy, 2018), we suggest that
attention to ODS is unlikely to be the primary mechanism underlying the
robustness of early vocal development in Tseltal. Furthermore, just
because speech is hearable does not mean the children are attending to
it. Follow-up work on the role of ODS in language development would need
better define what constitutes likely \enquote{listened to} speech by
the child.

\subsubsection{Increased CDS with age}\label{increased-cds-with-age}

Another possibility is that speakers more frequently address children
who are more communicatively competent (i.e., increased TCDS with age,
e.g., Warlaumont et al., 2016). In her longitudinal studies of Yucatec
Mayan children, Shneidman (2012) found that TCDS increased significantly
with age, from 55 utterances in an hour to 209 between 13 and 35 months.
However, most of the increase came from other children speaking to the
target child, a finding consistent with other reports that Mayan
children are more often cared for by their older siblings from later
infancy onward (2011, 2014). In our data, however, there was no evidence
for an overall increase in TCDS with age, neither from adult speakers
nor from child speakers. This non-increase in TCDS with age may be due
to the fact TCDS from other children was overall infrequent in our data
(cf. Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012), possibly because: (a) the
children were relatively young and so spent much of their time with
their mothers, (b) these particular children did not have many older
siblings, and (c) in the daylong recording context more adults were
present to talk to each other than would be typical in a short-format
recording (as used in Shneidman \& Goldin-Meadow, 2012). That aside, we
conclude from these findings, that an increase in TCDS with age is also
unlikely to explain the robust pattern of Tseltal vocal development.

\subsubsection{Learning during interactional
bursts}\label{learning-during-interactional-bursts}

A third possibility is that children learn effectively from short,
routine language encounters. Bursty input appears to be the norm across
a number of linguistic and interactive scales (e.g., Abney et al., 2017;
Blasi et al., in preparation), and experiment-based work suggests that
children can benefit from massed presentation of new information (Schwab
\& Lew-Williams, 2016). We propose two mechanisms through which Tseltal
children might capitalize on the distribution of speech input in their
environment: (a) they experience most language input during routine
activities and (b) they consolidate their language experiences during
the downtime between interactive peaks. Neither of these mechanisms are
proposed to be particular to Tseltal children, but might be employed to
explain their efficient learning.

Tseltal children's linguistic input is not uniformly distributed over
the day: children were most likely to encounter speech, particularly
directed, contingent speech in the mornings and late afternoons,
compared to midday. Older children, who are less often carried and were
therefore more free to seek out interactions, showed these time of day
effects most strongly, receiving more TCDS when more speakers were
present before and after the household disperses for farming work. A
similar midday dip has been previously found for North American
children's daylong recordings (Greenwood et al., 2011; Soderstrom \&
Wittebolle, 2013), suggesting that non-uniform distributions of
linguistic input may be the norm for children in a variety of different
cultural-economic contexts. Our paper is the first to show that those
time of day effects change with age in the first few years on a number
of speech environment features (TCDS, TC--O transitions, O--TC
transitions, and (marginally) ODS). These time of day effects likely
arise from the activities that typically occur in the mornings and late
afternoons---meal preparation and dining in particular---while napping
could contribute to the midday dip (Soderstrom \& Wittebolle, 2013).
That said, in data from North American children, the highest density
speech input came during storytime and organized playtime (e.g.,
sing-alongs, painting), while mealtime was associated with less speech
input. We expect that follow-up research tracking activities in the
Tseltal data will lead to very different conclusions: storytime and
organized playtime are vanishingly rare in this non-child-centric
community, and mealtime may represent a time of routine and rich
linguistic experience. In both cases, however, the underlying
association with activity (not hour) implies a role for action routines
that help children optimally extract information about what they will
encounter and what they are expected to do in response, even over short
periods (see, e.g., Bruner, 1983; Snow \& Goldfield, 1983; Catherine S
Tamis-LeMonda, Custode, Kuchirko, Escobar, \& Lo, 2018).

A more speculative possibility is that Tseltal children learn language
on a natural input-consolidation cycle: the rarity of interactional
peaks throughout the day may be complemented by an opportunity to
consolidate new information. Sleep has been shown to benefit language
learning tasks in both adults (Frost \& Monaghan, 2017; Mirković \&
Gaskell, 2016) and children (Gómez, Bootzin, \& Nadel, 2006; Horváth,
Liu, \& Plunkett, 2016; Hupbach, Gomez, Bootzin, \& Nadel, 2009),
including word learning, phonotactic constraints, and syntactic
structure. Our impression, both from the recordings and informal
observations made during visits to the community, is that young Tseltal
children take frequent naps, particularly at younger ages when they
spend much of their day wrapped within the shawl on their mother's back.
Mayan children tend to pick their own resting times (i.e., there are no
formalized ``sleep'' times, even at bedtime Morelli, Rogoff, Oppenheim,
\& Goldsmith, 1992), and Mayan mothers take special care to keep infants
in a calm and soothing environment in the first few months of life
(e.g., de León, 2000; Pye, 1992). There is little quantitative data on
Mayan children's daytime and nighttime sleeping patterns, but one study
estimates that Yucatec Mayan children between 0;0 and 2;0 sleep or rest
nearly 15\% of the time between morning and evening (Gaskins, 2000),
again, at times that suited the child (Morelli et al., 1992). If Tseltal
children's interactional peaks are bookended by short naps, it could
contribute to efficient consolidation of new information encountered.
How often Tseltal children sleep, how deeply, and how their sleeping
patterns may relate to their linguistic development is an important
topic for future research.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}\label{disc-limfut}

The current findings are based on a cross-sectional analysis of 600
annotated recording minutes, divided among only ten children. The data
are limited mainly to verbal activity; we cannot analyze gaze and
gestural behavior (Brown, 2014). We have also used vocal maturity rating
as an index of language development, but further work should include
receptive and productive measures of linguistic skill, using experiment-
and questionnaire- based measures that build on past linguistic work
(Brown, 1997, 1998b, 1998a, 2011, 2014; Brown \& Gaskins, 2014). In
short, more and more diverse data are needed to enrich this initial
description of Tseltal children's language environments. Importantly,
the current analyses are based on a corpus that is still under active
development: as new data are added, up-to-date versions of these
analyses will be available with the current data and analysis scripts
can be found: ADD-URL.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{disc-conclusion}

We estimate that, over the course of a waking day, Tseltal children
under age 3;0 hear an average of 3.6 minutes of directed speech per
hour. Contingent turn-taking tends to occur in sparsely distributed
bursts, often in the mornings and afternoons, particularly in the
mornings for older children. Tseltal children's vocal maturity is
on-track with prior estimates from populations in which child-directed
speech is much more frequent, raising a challenge for future work: how
do Tseltal children efficiently extract information from their
linguistic environments? In our view, a promising avenue for continued
research is to more closely investigate the activity/time-of-day effects
and a possible input-consolidation cycle for language exposure in early
development. By better understanding how Tseltal children learn
language, we hope to uncover some of the ways in which human language
learning mechanisms are adaptive to the many thousands of
ethnolinguistic environments in which children develop.
